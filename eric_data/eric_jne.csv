EJ1214082,Black Mixed-Race Male Experiences of the UK Secondary School Curriculum,"Drawing on findings from 20 semi-structured interviews carried out in 2013, this article seeks to contribute to the limited body of literature exploring the schooling experiences of the mixed-race population in the United Kingdom. Taking a particular focus on the secondary school curriculum, the article provides examples in which Black mixed-race males identify as Black and as mixed-race, interchangeably and simultaneously. Therefore, the article suggests that if we are to fully understand the experiences of Black mixed-race males, the development of a new conceptual framework that acknowledges the coalescence of Blackness and mixedness is necessary. Although the focus remains on Black mixed-race male pupils, the analysis may raise new questions for the way we view mixed-race populations.","Joseph-Salisbury\, Remi","Foreign Countries,Blacks,Males,Multiracial Persons,Secondary School Students,Student Experience,Secondary School Curriculum","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2017,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

EJ1214083,Looking for Brothers: Black Male Bonding at a Predominantly White Institution,"This article seeks to examine Black male bonding at a predominantly White university. Prior research suggests that Black students seek social connections with other Black students as a means for negating the discomforts of racial alienation. However, these friendships are not always sought solely in response to difficulties integrating into White environments or combatting stereotypes. The authors emphasize emotional and social causes to explain the bonds Black men wished to create as they left the familiarity of home and moved on to the new environment of college. The authors find that these men sought these relationships because they lacked friends, wished to recreate family and family-like relationships, and wanted to associate with successful Black male peers.","Jackson\, Brandon A.,Hui\, Mary Margaret","College Students,African American Students,Racial Composition,College Environment,Whites,Minority Group Students,Males,Peer Relationship,Friendship,Student Attitudes,Family Environment","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2017,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

Additionally, teacher perceptions of positive behavior interventions and supports (PBIS) implementation were explored. No statistically significant relationship was found between student participation in PBIS Tier II behavior interventions and academic achievement. However, there were significant differences in the percentages of male students, students of color, and students from high poverty backgrounds who were identified as needing Tier II behavioral interventions by the predominantly White, female, middle class teachers.

EJ1214087,The Effects of Professors&apos; Race and Clothing Style on Student Evaluations,"This study examined the effects of professors' race and clothing style on student evaluations. Students were randomly assigned to one of four conditions in which they received a photograph and description of a professor. The only difference between conditions was the photograph, which systematically varied race (Black or White) and clothing style (casual or formal). Both Black and White students rated the Black professor less favorably than the White professor. Students trusted the Black professor more when he was pictured in formal compared to casual clothing, while the reverse was true for the White professor.

EJ1214088,A Comparison of Reading and Math Achievement for African American Third Grade Students in Montessori and Other Magnet Schools,"Montessori programs are expanding in public schools, serving a large proportion of African American students. Although recent Montessori research has focused on diverse public school populations, few studies have examined outcomes for African American students at the lower elementary level. This quasi-experimental study compares reading and math achievement for African American third grade students in public Montessori and other magnet schools in a large, urban district in North Carolina. Scores from end-of-grade state tests of reading and math are compared using a multivariate analysis of covariance. No significant difference in math scores was identified, but students in Montessori schools scored significantly higher in reading. This suggests that Montessori lower elementary instruction may be beneficial for African American students.","Brown\, Katie,Lewis\, Chance W.","African American Students,Elementary School Students,Grade 3,Montessori Schools,Magnet Schools,Reading Achievement,Mathematics Achievement,Urban Schools,Comparative Analysis,Public Schools,School Effectiveness","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2017,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

Specifically, the authors explore how families shape the academic and college-going motivations of Black native students and Black immigrant students. Findings suggest that irrespective of ethnicity or nativity, students' academic motivation typically stemmed from family, with students describing a family expectation that they go to college. Students' self-motivation and future goal orientation also intersected with family as a source of motivation. Nevertheless, distinctions emerged across ethnicity and nativity in perceptions of how family influenced academic motivation and the messages students received from family members about college-going and academic performance.","Mwangi\, Chrystal A.

EJ1214130,The Heterogeneity of Resistance: How Black Students Utilize Engagement and Activism to Challenge PWI Inequalities,"The national prevalence of systemic bias, such as police brutality, has influenced resistance to institutionalized racism on college campuses. Because of the daily microaggressions Black students experience at predominantly White institutions, they often utilize various forms of engagement and activism to hold institutions accountable for equity in higher education. Through this study the authors examined how Black student leaders challenge inequitable policies through their individual as well as collective efforts. Using a social identity framework and case study methodology, Black student leaders' reflections on their strategies in invoking change on campus are explored. Through heterogeneous approaches of engagement and activism, participants called attention to the greater need of communities of color being included in institutional reform.","Jones\, Veronica A.,Reddick\, Richard J.","African American Students,Learner Engagement,Activism,College Students,Institutional Characteristics,Whites,Resistance (Psychology),Campuses,Higher Education,Minority Group Students,Leadership","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2017,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

Findings highlight varied patterns across college men and women. Endorsing just world beliefs related to more civic engagement over time, and this relationship was stronger for more politically efficacious Black men. Among Black women, perceiving negative campus racial climate (racial tension and mistrust) promoted civic engagement, especially among those higher in political efficacy. Results highlight the importance of considering individual and contextual-level factors in studying Black college students' civic engagement. The authors discuss ways to provide support for students given the current sociopolitical climates on many college campuses.","Leath\, Seanna,Chavous\, Tabbye","College Students,African American Students,Political Attitudes,Beliefs,Self Efficacy,Racial Relations,Racial Bias,Citizen Participation,Activism,Social Justice,Gender Differences,World Views,Predictor Variables,Resistance (Psychology)","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2017,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

In this lecture Dr. Joyce Elaine King delineates the African philosophical and epistemological roots of this tradition in the works of historical Black educators and theoreticians as well as scholar activists today whose inquiries also challenge the myth of &quot;objectivity&quot; in social science research. This eurocratic paradigm, which admonishes us to be &quot;objective,&quot; often creates role conflict and alienates us from our people. Instead, the Black Liberation tradition in education as well as research favors partisan scientific inquiry and praxis in the interest of equity, racial justice and human freedom.

Methods included journal writing, focus groups, interviews, and a questionnaire. Findings reveal that teachers found it difficult to positively impact Black student achievement because of frustrating situations they faced, including institutional, pedagogical, relational, positional, and cultural frustrations.

Using an example, I describe the process through which Black girls and women are rendered invisible in mathematics. To conclude, I call for the creation, occupation, and sharing of positive, socio-epistemic spaces that allow for the visibility of Black girls and women in mathematics.","Gholson\, Maisie L.","Females,African Americans,Mathematics Instruction,Mathematics Achievement,Participation,Whites,Males,Social Bias,Racial Bias,Educational History,United States History,Gender Bias,Minority Group Students,STEM Education","Journal Articles,Reports - Evaluative",2016,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

By using bell hooks' (1992) &quot;oppositional gaze&quot; concept as a frame, it argues that Black girls' development of a critical lens and analytic skills is tied to images in the media and central to their positive development. The article draws on qualitative data from a larger phenomenological study that explores how adolescent Black girls who attend independent schools employ critical lenses to understand their experiences around race, gender, and class.

EJ1215942,The Influence of Math Self-Efficacy on the College Enrollments of Young Black Women,"National studies indicate that units and level of rigor in mathematics coursework are the strongest predictors of college enrollment. However, for young Black women there are often structural barriers impeding access to rigorous mathematics coursework, potentially impinging on postsecondary enrollment. In the present study the authors analyze the relationship between math self-efficacy and student propensity to enroll in any postsecondary institution as well as the relationship between math self-efficacy and the propensity enroll in four-year postsecondary institutions for Black women high school students. To do so, the authors use the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Educational Longitudinal Survey of 2002 and find that for young Black women students, having a higher math self-efficacy is positively associated with enrollment in a four-year institution. Unfortunately, their math self-efficacy erodes over time and lower mathematics self-efficacies are negatively associated with postsecondary enrollment. As students who start in a four-year environment are more likely to complete the baccalaureate degree, encouraging mathematics self-efficacy development is a logical step toward improving Black women's educational attainment.","Chambers\, Crystal R.,Walpole\, MaryBeth,Outlaw\, Nolan","Mathematics Education,Self Efficacy,College Attendance,Enrollment,African American Students,High School Students,Females,Mathematics Achievement,Postsecondary Education,Academic Aspiration,Student Characteristics","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2016,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

This inquiry resolves the literature gap by examining the narratives of academically successful African American female collegians regarding their single mother's parenting acts and grooming toward collegiate achievement. In contrast to pathologizing studies, this study found that low-income African American single mothers: (1) sociocultural identity stimulated their daughter's academic stamina; (2) developed their daughter's steadfast character by embracing their perceived oppression; (3) authoritative parenting style internally admonished and motivated their daughter; and (4) extended a degree of trust, which facilitated their daughter's academic independence.","Johnson\, Johnitha Watkins","African Americans,One Parent Family,Mothers,Daughters,College Students,Academic Achievement,Parent Student Relationship,Low Income Groups,Personal Narratives,Parent Influence,Parenting Styles","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2016,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

This study surveyed 130 parents/guardians of Black K-12 students throughout the United States to identify the strategies and resources they use in engaging with their children's education. The families exhibited high rates of supporting learning at home, communicating with schools, and providing educational experiences in the community. Participants reported using two types of resources: programs and organizations geared specifically to Black students and their parents and social interactions through friends, parents, and the Internet. School personnel may improve communication and collaboration with Black parents by revisiting policy and restructuring engagement programs to incorporate this information.","Latunde\, Yvette,Clark-Louque\, Angela","Parent Participation,Achievement Gap,Academic Achievement,Equal Education,African American Students,Elementary School Students,Secondary School Students,Family Environment,Parent School Relationship,Parent Child Relationship,Parents as Teachers,Educational Opportunities,Community Resources","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2016,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

EJ1215946,The Value of a Triangle: Mathematics Education in Industrial and Classical Schools in the Segregated South,"This article presents findings from a larger on-going study examining the mathematics and science education of African Americans from 1854-1954. The overarching research question was &quot;What type of mathematics education experiences did Blacks living in the South have during de jure segregation?&quot; Archival materials from nine historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) were interrogated using critical content analysis to describe mathematics content and learning for Blacks during segregation; an unexplored history. Critical Race Theory was used to frame the study and make meaning of the findings. Analysis of archival data suggests three important findings: (a) mathematics education for Blacks during de jure segregation reflected two distinct philosophies-- classical (liberal arts) and industrial (technical); (b) Black students were trained in pure and applied mathematics, and mathematics education; and (c) Black students engaged in rigorous mathematics. Answers may uncover important educational history, providing contemporary researchers and policymakers new insights and considerations in designing educational reform related to African Americans and mathematics education.","Joseph\, Nicole M.,Jordan-Taylor\, Donna","Mathematics Education,African American Education,Educational History,Racial Segregation,Black Colleges,Critical Theory,Race,Educational Philosophy,African American Students,College Students","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2016,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

EJ1215947,Preparing Black Male Teachers for the Gifted Classroom: Recommendations for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs),"Nationally, the recruitment and retention of Black male teachers have become a crisis for public schools at all educational and academic programmatic levels. This is especially true for gifted and AP programs, considering that most Black males who enter the teaching profession are rarely selected to serve in such teaching capacities. However, what has been missing from the extant research literature is the role Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) play in the preparation of Black male teachers for the gifted classroom. In this article, the authors explore scholarship that focuses on the lack of diversity among teachers and specifically among males in general education to draw implications to the field of gifted education. The authors provide specific attention to reasons HBCUs play an important role in preparing Black males for the gifted classroom, along with providing recommendations for preparing Black male teachers in gifted education.","Bryan\, Nathaniel,Johnson\, Lamar,Williams\, Toni Milton","African American Teachers,Males,Gifted Education,Black Colleges,Preservice Teacher Education,College Role,Advanced Placement Programs,Student Experience,African American Students,Academically Gifted,Student Needs,General Education","Journal Articles,Reports - Evaluative",2016,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

EJ1215948,Addressing Disproportionality in Special Education Using a Universal Screening Approach,"Current research places an emphasis on outcomes, rather than the processes, that lead to disproportionality in special education. In most instances, referrals for special education are based on teacher perception, rather than data. Using a norm-referenced self-report instrument to assess behavioral and emotional risk, this study compared those identified as at-risk by the instrument to those presently receiving special education services within a nationally representative sample of 4946 children. The results indicated demographics including gender, race, and socioeconomic status were more predictive of special education status than self-report of risk. These findings suggest that a data-driven approach to inform referral for special education may contribute to efforts to reduce the disproportionate placement of students of color and males in special education.","Dever\, Bridget V.,Raines\, Tara C.,Dowdy\, Erin,Hostutler\, Cody","Disproportionate Representation,Special Education,Screening Tests,Comparative Analysis,At Risk Students,Minority Group Students,Males,Child Behavior,Rating Scales,Emotional Problems,Behavior Problems","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2016,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

EJ1215949,Josephs without Pharaohs: The Du Boisian Framework for the Sociology of Education,"A Du Boisian framework is outlined for the sociology of education. Because of the totalizing nature of racial inequality, W. E. B. Du Bois was forced to simultaneously consider Black students' educational experiences and outcomes at both the macro and micro levels. The framework's central problematic is the macro-micro feedback loop between racial inequalities in the U.S. political economy and discriminatory treatment of Black students in schools. For Du Bois, the feedback loop perpetuates multigenerational educational inequality. This article uses a Du Boisian framework to situate research findings on within-school racial inequalities (such as racialized tracking) and between-school racial inequalities (such as urban/suburban school segregation) in a broader analytical context. Situating previous research as such indicates avenues for future scholarship and activism surrounding the issues facing Black students in U.S. schools.","Conwell\, Jordan A.","Educational Sociology,African American Students,African American Education,Educational Opportunities,Equal Education,Racial Bias,Educational Practices,Track System (Education),School Segregation,Racial Segregation,Activism","Journal Articles,Reports - Evaluative",2016,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

Findings from this study suggested that verbal persuasion and vicarious experiences were the strongest predictors of self-efficacy as the two students attributed their success to supportive peers, family, faculty and engaging in welcoming communities. Student challenges to success included feelings of isolation while developing an academic trajectory, compounded by uninvolved or ambivalent faculty, difficult dissertation committee dynamics, and not asking for help. Self-efficacy provided a useful framework to help understand these experiences and the multiple variables impacting academic success in the context of doctoral studies for African American women graduate students in these types of institutions.","Dortch\, Deniece","Phenomenology,Academic Achievement,Self Efficacy,African American Students,Females,Doctoral Students,Doctoral Programs,Doctoral Degrees,Institutional Characteristics,Whites,Predictor Variables,Minority Group Students","Journal Articles,Reports - Research,Tests/Questionnaires",2016,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

This research briefly reviews the concept of Black masculinity from a critical theory lens, situating it within the college milieu. Critical race theory (CRT) is introduced as a practical approach for challenging hegemonic ideologies about Black masculinity. CRT calls for the use of counter-narratives as a way for marginalized groups to retake ownership of their authentic voice.

However, little is known about these women due to the racialized and gendered narratives that collectively shroud their lives of and contribute to their disposability. Black women who go missing receive limited, negative, or no attention at all. Capturing attention requires their lives to be proven worthy, which is difficult when Black women narratives are linked to crime, mental illness and other issues to suggest they were some how responsible or deserving of their predicament. In this article we use a critical race feminist (CRF) framework and introduce a CRF methodology to center the stories of missing Black undergraduate women, disrupt the invisibility and disposability that ensures silence around their lives and highlight the need for more scholarly efforts that focus on Black women.","Patton\, Lori D.,Ward\, LaWanda W.","Undergraduate Students,African American Students,Females,Victims of Crime,Critical Theory,Race,Feminism,Racial Bias,News Media,News Reporting,Law Enforcement,Power Structure","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2016,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

Ground-breaking decisions birthed the inclusion of affirmative action policies in higher education after the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In recent years, both the utility and constitutionality of race-based admission practices have been challenged, and in some cases, have threatened to destroy contemporary notions of diversity, fostered through affirmative action policies. As affirmative action policies continue to be attacked and ultimately prohibited in some states, many colleges are halting the use of race-sensitive admission practices. As such, the purpose of this research is to discuss a policy contradiction by which public postsecondary educational institutions are aiming to foster the racial diversity of their campuses. To help those institutions where the use of affirmative action is permissible, but leaders are fearful of doing so because of litigation concerns, this article provides several recommendations for institutions to promote racial diversity on their campus.","Boykin\, Tiffany Fountaine,Palmer\, Robert T.","School Segregation,Racial Segregation,Affirmative Action,Higher Education,Court Litigation,Civil Rights Legislation,Federal Legislation,College Admission,Admission Criteria,Diversity (Institutional),Student Diversity,College Students,Equal Education,State Legislation","Journal Articles,Reports - Evaluative",2016,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

EJ1215966,Overcoming Obstacles: African American Students with Disabilities Achieving Academic Success,"Concerns regarding the overrepresentation of minority groups, particularly African Americans, in special education date back many years. While practices such as culturally responsive teaching and response to intervention have been implemented to combat the erroneous placement of students in special education programs, an important focus that remains is the academic progress and postsecondary outcomes for African American students placed in special education programs. To increase the number of African American students with disabilities (SWDs) who successfully pursue postsecondary education at the college or university level, taking a step back and focusing on factors that have led to the success of school-aged African American SWDs is important. In an attempt to counter the vast amount of negative information found in current literature regarding African Americans in special education, this study highlights two African American high school SWDs who have demonstrated academic success. Teachers who work closely with the students, the parents of the two students, and the students themselves were interviewed and observed to gain insight about factors they attribute to each student's academic success. Upon transcribing and analyzing interview data, three key themes emerged: (a) expectations, (b) support, and (c) organization. This article discusses these findings and also describes other noteworthy findings, including a spirit of teamwork among the individuals and the practice of inclusion as an important factor in each student's academic success. Finally, the authors discuss limitations of the study along with implications for future research and practice.","Gatlin\, Brandy T.,Wilson\, Cynthia L.","Barriers,African American Students,Students with Disabilities,Academic Achievement,Success,Disproportionate Representation,Special Education,Postsecondary Education,High School Students,Parent Teacher Cooperation,Teacher Student Relationship,Student Needs,Teacher Expectations of Students,Family Involvement,Tutoring,Role Models,Study Skills,Goal Orientation","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2016,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

Using ethnographic case study data from 38 African American students and 26 parents who lived in a poor Black neighborhood and attended a predominantly White middle school, the researchers contend that out-of-school time provided context for distinct struggles and experiences that heavily influenced the students' educational experiences. The negative perceptions of their neighborhood and intergenerational tracking were implicated in an unequal distribution of knowledge, resources, and opportunities in the students' homes and community. Moreover, the agency and cultural knowledge of African Americans were unacknowledged, thereby contributing to systemic inequalities.","Lofton\, Richard,Davis\, James Earl","African American Students,Parents,African Americans,Racial Bias,Social Bias,Cultural Awareness,Poverty,Middle School Students,Racial Composition,Whites,Racial Differences,Neighborhoods,Experience,Track System (Education),At Risk Students,Culturally Relevant Education,African American History,Principals,School Counselors,Clergy,Community Leaders,Attitudes","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2015,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

EJ1216054,Examining the Effects of Urban Neighborhoods on the Mental Health of Adolescent African American Males: A Qualitative Systematic Review,"Residing in high-risk urban neighborhoods has a significant impact on the optimal psychosocial development of adolescent African American males. Living in these environments often increases exposure to economic distress and attendance at under-resourced schools, which may diminish opportunities for successful life outcomes. This qualitative systematic review examines how continuous exposure to high-risk neighborhoods affects the mental health of adolescent African American males. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, twelve articles were systematically reviewed. Results suggest that African American male adolescents continuously exposed to negative characteristics within their neighborhoods display higher rates of depression, and other symptoms of psychological distress. However, further research is needed to identify the specific mechanisms in high-risk neighborhoods that are most salient in increasing their negative mental health symptoms.","Perry\, Danielle M.,Tabb\, Karen M.","Urban Areas,Mental Health,Adolescents,African Americans,Males,At Risk Persons,Neighborhoods,Environmental Influences,Depression (Psychology),Psychological Patterns,Stress Variables,Mental Disorders,Poverty,Symptoms (Individual Disorders)","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2015,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

EJ1216057,&quot;You Can&apos;t Help a Child if You Don&apos;t Know Something Yourself&quot;: A Qualitative Study of Barriers to Education in an Underserved West Baltimore Community,"There have been numerous efforts to simultaneously increase awareness and reduce the impact of health disparities and educational inequities. Initiatives have included designing, testing and training on selective interventions, as well as promoting progressive policymaking at local, state, and national levels. Input from the community is essential in building a cradle-to-career continuum of learning and other associated supports. A series of five different focus groups were held with various stakeholders in an underserved community--mothers in a prenatal program (n = 5); youth and young adults (n = 9); community residents (n = 13); principals (n = 5); and teachers and school staff (n = 14). These focus groups were intended to inform research on how children are learning, and how community supports impact student learning. Key themes that emerged included barriers to educational achievement and health promotion, which includes mental health and self-esteem, parental support, early childhood education, and access to healthy food options.","Finigan-Carr\, Nadine,Vandigo\, Joseph,Uretsky\, Mathew,Oloyede\, Ebenezer O.,Mayden\, Bronwyn","Barriers,Access to Education,Urban Areas,Equal Education,Mothers,Youth,Young Adults,Stakeholders,Principals,Teachers,School Personnel,Health Promotion,Academic Achievement,Mental Health,Self Esteem,Parent Role,Early Childhood Education,Nutrition,Career Readiness,Job Skills,Program Effectiveness,Attitudes","Journal Articles,Reports - Research,Tests/Questionnaires",2015,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

EJ1216058,"Black Parents as Advocates, Motivators, and Teachers of Mathematics","There is growing need to showcase the agency and determination of African American parents seeking equitable educational opportunities for their children, given that their narratives defy mainstream stereotypes of passivity, disinterest, and lack of effort. In this article the authors investigate the early role of parents in fostering sustainable mathematics and academic success among 24 high-achieving Black college students in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. In particular, this study sheds light on the ways parents support their children's mathematics participation and learning in and outside of school settings. Black parental involvement is misunderstood. This research shows that African American parents are aware of educational inequities and respond by becoming advocates, motivators, and even early teachers of mathematics for their children.","McGee\, Ebony,Spencer\, Margaret Beale","Parent Role,African Americans,Equal Education,Mathematics Instruction,Success,High Achievement,College Students,African American Students,STEM Education,Parents as Teachers,Parent Participation,Advocacy,Educational History,African American History,Socialization,Mentors","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2015,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

Parents reported low levels of financial stress, which were unrelated to children's school readiness. Parents' general stress levels were significantly related to both parent and teacher reports of children's psychosocial problems, however, the direction of effect differed (e.g., positive versus negative, respectively).

Seventy-four 4th and 5th graders of African descent from an urban neighborhood in the United States, completed self-report questionnaires on the variables of interest. The authors found that exposure to violence was negatively correlated to academic self-esteem, and support was established for parental involvement as a moderator between exposure to violence and academic performance. The results indicate that children of African descent who are exposed to increased community violence may have lower academic self-esteem. Furthermore, increased parental involvement in the child's academic activities provides a buffer between exposure to violence and the child's academic outcomes.","Barker\, Orlando,Roberts\, Debra D.","Parent Participation,Violence,Academic Achievement,African American Students,African Americans,Urban Areas,Self Esteem,Correlation,Resilience (Psychology),Grade 4,Grade 5,Middle School Students,Environmental Influences","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2015,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

With post-admission administrative data on newly admitted freshmen for the 2009-2010 academic year, the authors use a count data estimator to calculate the responsiveness of course hours taken to changes in tuition and household income at the intensive margin. The results reveal that student course hour enrollment-- which translate into measures of official full-time equivalent enrollment--is inelastic with respect to price and elastic with respect to household income. The intensive margin enrollment price elasticity estimates also support a high tuition/high financial aid pricing scheme that uses tuition revenue to cross-subsidize the price of enrollment for financially needy students, which maximizes college access for Black males.","Price\, Gregory,Sheftall\, Willis","College Freshmen,Enrollment,Black Colleges,African American Students,Males,Single Sex Colleges,Student Financial Aid,Tuition,Access to Education","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2015,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

EJ1216184,Challenges to Success in Higher Education: An Examination of Educational Challenges from the Voices of College-Bound Black Males,"In recent years, researchers have devoted much discussion to finding ways to increase the academic success of Black males in K-12 and higher education. Despite this emphasis, Black male enrollment in higher education stands at 4.5%, which is the same as it was in 1976. One factor noted by researchers for the stagnation among Black male college enrollment is their disproportionate departure from high school. Therefore, this qualitative study of college-bound high school seniors discusses four critical factors that contribute to Black males premature departure from high school.

EJ1216385,Domain-Specific Cognitive Stimulation and Maternal Sensitivity as Predictors of Early Academic Outcomes among Low-Income African American Preschoolers,"This study examined the degree to which dimensions of parenting predicted early academic outcomes in a sample of 111 low-income African American children. Three aspects of parenting were assessed when the children were 36 months old: language stimulation, math-related stimulation, and maternal sensitivity. Academic outcomes were assessed at 54 months and included children's applied problem solving skills, letter-word identification, and vocabulary. Although the findings suggested that maternal sensitivity and cognitive stimulation are related to early academic skills for low-income African American preschoolers, the results of regression analyses varied depending on the outcome measure. Of particular interest is the finding that language stimulation was a stronger predictor for boys than for girls.","Harris\, Toni,Sideris\, John,Serpell\, Zewelanji,Burchinal\, Margaret,Pickett\, Chloe","Mothers,Parent Child Relationship,African American Children,Preschool Children,Low Income,Parenting Styles,Academic Achievement,Toddlers,Language Acquisition,Mathematics Skills,Problem Solving,Alphabets,Gender Differences,Child Development,Cognitive Development,Stimulation,Vocabulary Development,Emergent Literacy,Parent Participation,Family Environment,Achievement Tests,Cognitive Tests,Intelligence Tests,Verbal Ability,Vocabulary,Observation,Educational Background,Predictor Variables","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2014,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

The study employed two instruments: (a) a student background questionnaire and (b) an environmental science teacher designed test. The instruments were administered to grade 12 students, of which 79% were African Americans and 21% Afro-Caribbeans. A correlational design was used and results compared for the groups. Results revealed that Black Caribbean students outperformed Black American students and parents' discussion of school progress and assistance with homework were some of the factors that significantly correlated with students' achievement. Moreover, findings suggest the positive impact of the migration of first-generation Black Caribbean immigrants to the U.S. may be influencing their children's academic success.","Pinder\, Patrice,Prime\, Glenda,Wilson\, Jonathan","African American Students,Blacks,Minority Group Students,Correlation,Environmental Education,Grade 12,High School Seniors,Science Achievement,Homework,Student Characteristics,Achievement Gap,Parent Influence,Predictor Variables,Parent Role,Immigrants","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2014,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

Evaluating Choice, Rhetoric and Practices","Du Bois poses a poignant question in 1935 based on the logic that Black children need to be in schools where they are valued and inspired whether that environment is a separate school or an &quot;integrated&quot; school. This question of the effects of different educational spaces still begs to be answered in the changing landscape of secondary and postsecondary education for African American students and especially African American males.

For most of our nation's history, it was taken for granted that academic skill levels among some groups would be lower, on average, than for others. Indeed, a culture of White supremacy maintained a division of labor that relegated people of color disproportionately to jobs in which academic skill was not a requirement. Now, several contemporary trends warrant birth-to-career changes in how the nation prepares all children for life in the twenty-first century. I describe those trends and propose key elements of a movement befitting this moment in history.","Ferguson\, Ronald F.","Equal Education,Educational Trends,Achievement Gap,Academic Achievement,African American Students,Hispanic American Students,White Students,Racial Differences,Trend Analysis,Parent Participation,Educational Quality,Teacher Effectiveness,Peer Influence,Goal Orientation,Well Being","Journal Articles,Reports - Descriptive",2014,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

This investigation was viewed through nine academic years (2002 to 2010) and in those states where the United States v. Fordice decision mandated the dismantling of 'de facto segregation' practices. When referring to matters of governance contrary to a regulation, this means in custom but not necessarily ordained by law. In the case regarding capital spending per full time equivalent (FTE) between the combined HBCUs and PWIs population, the Maim-Whitney U tests revealed several instances where there were disparities in capital spending between the two groups. Of the researched periods, PWIs overall capital spending patterns were statistically higher than HBCUs in six of the nine years. These findings agree with anecdotal accusations that alleged capital spending ambiguities still exist after the Fordice decision.","Brown\, Walter A.,Burnette\, Daarel","Black Colleges,Educational Finance,Resource Allocation,Expenditures,Institutional Characteristics,Racial Composition,Whites,Court Litigation,Educational Equity (Finance),Racial Bias,Desegregation Litigation,School Desegregation,Civil Rights Legislation,Federal Legislation,Success,Enrollment,Academic Persistence,Graduation Rate,Academic Degrees,Financial Support","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2014,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

EJ1216571,Is Integration a Dream Deferred? Students of Color in Majority White Suburban Schools,"Suburban schools have traditionally remained homogenous enclaves for White middle class families. On the surface, these racially integrated spaces reflect the dream of Brown v. Board of Education--to have students of all races learning and developing together. A closer look at these racially mixed environments unveils the systemic problems students of color face when attending majority White suburban schools. Using focus group interviews from almost 100 students of color in four suburban districts, the author examines how the students' relationships with school adults impact their educational experiences and future college and career choices.

Board of Education&quot; and ordered the desegregation of students by race in public schools. Many of the states as well as the federal executive branch of government expressed some level of opposition to this order. Over time, courts have taken alternative positions on the education of persons of color, some of which have the potential for undermining the original ruling in the Brown decision. This research will offer an analysis of these trends in American education, exposing the paradox of how an emphasis on supposed achievement tends to trump educational equality for African American students.

It is difficult to discuss any area of athletics without noting the variable of race. An illusion that sports are free from racism may be interpreted from current player statistics; however on closer examination racism is evident. Although there is an overrepresentation of African American athletes, the decision-making duties found in such occupations as ownership, leadership, and management positions are still largely occupied by White males. This study examines the perception of racism by 20 former Division I student-athletes on Division I-A campuses. The data are presented in the form of narratives as former student-athletes discuss race and sport and the role that racism played in their athletic careers.","Beamon\, Krystal","African American Students,Males,Racial Bias,Ethnic Stereotypes,Athletes,College Athletics,Student Experience,Critical Theory,Race,Racial Differences,White Students,Social Bias,Team Sports,College Environment","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2014,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

Board&quot; of Education of Topeka Kansas case in 1954, many present day African American students still attend segregated schools. Within these &quot;de facto&quot; segregated schools, students meet challenges to educational achievement. In a sample of 160 African American students, the current study examined the relationships among parental racial socialization techniques, school-based discrimination, and future academic expectations. Results showed that cultural socialization messages from parents are salient as these messages act as moderators in the relationship between future academic expectations and peer and teacher-based discrimination, respectively. Thus, in de facto segregated public schools, messages that African American parents give their students assist their students in developing resilient educational pathways.","Trask-Tate\, Angelique J.,Cunningham\, Michael,Francois\, Samantha","Desegregation Litigation,School Desegregation,Socialization,Public Schools,African American Students,School Segregation,Racial Segregation,Barriers,Academic Achievement,Parent Influence,Expectation,Racial Discrimination,Cultural Influences,Correlation,Parent Role,Resilience (Psychology),High School Students,Socioeconomic Status,Gender Differences","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2014,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

EJ1216598,Using Culturally Responsive Practices to Broaden Participation in the Educational Pipeline: Addressing the Unfinished Business of &quot;Brown&quot; in the Field of Computing Sciences,"The effective integration of African American students into previously segregated careers was one of the main goals of the &quot;Brown&quot; decision and, in turn, the outcomes of such efforts have been the subject of much scholarly interest). This qualitative study, drawing on critical race theorist Derrick Bell's critique of &quot;Brown,&quot; makes the case for applying culturally relevant pedagogy theory (CRPT) to positively impact student achievement and career choice, particularly as it relates to the STEM field of computing sciences. Cultural barriers such as early exposure to technology, students' perceptions of their own potential in the field, and the lack of culturally relevant social support, often deter African American students from pursuing careers in STEM fields, particularly computing sciences. Although there is a dearth in the literature regarding how to expand the pipeline to computing sciences using culturally specific practices, this study produced results that suggest culturally responsive practices as an effective method for broadening participation in computing. Using CRPT, this qualitative study identifies culturally relevant practices that positively affect the persistence of African Americans in the STEM field of computing science.","Charleston\, LaVar J.,Charleston\, Sherri Ann,Jackson\, Jerlando F.

In this case, the encounter experience was completing two Implicit Association Tests--one on race and one on skin tone. The researchers examined the discussion board entries of 302 early childhood and elementary teachers enrolled in the course and found that teacher reactions generally typified one of five categories: (a) disregard for the results, (b) disbelief in the results, (c) acceptance of the results, (d) discomfort with the results, and, finally, (e) distress with the results. The results are discussed in the context of helping teachers become aware of the potential impact of bias on the teaching and learning process.

Instead, by law in Missouri, there is a regional effect that is largely ignored in most discussions of high-stakes accountability. The goal of this article is to examine two local student transfer legal cases (&quot;Turner v. Clayton,&quot; 2010 and &quot;Breitenfeld v. Clayton,&quot; 2013) with a specific focus on the inter-district implications. This case study provides a unique example of how accreditation decisions have the potential to foster unanticipated inter-district student assignment patterns and interdependent regional educational responsibilities. The transfer cases are not technically desegregation cases, yet in the St. Louis metropolitan region they represent the continuation of desegregation policy in that both called for inter-district student access in the region. We conducted this case study to understand more clearly how equity, achievement, and attainment might be supported among children in a metropolitan region. The transfer cases are important legal decisions in that they call on a metropolitan community to be responsible for the education of young persons.","Tate\, William F.,Hamilton\, Christopher,Robertson\, William Brett,Jones\, Brittni D.,Wallington\, Elizabeth Thorne,Schultz\, Lyndsie M.","Accountability,Court Litigation,School Districts,Accreditation (Institutions),Transfer Students,School Desegregation,Equal Education,Metropolitan Areas","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2014,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

EJ1216608,The Expanding Gender and Racial Gap in American Higher Education,"Sixty years have passed since the pivotal 1954 Supreme Court case of &quot;Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas&quot; and almost fifty years have elapsed since the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Brown decision dismantled public segregated schools in many parts of the country, especially in the South, and racial access in schools expanded. However, current assessments of educational progress such as troubling signs of &quot;re-segregated schools,&quot; lower retention and graduation rates for non-white high school students, declining academic performance, and smaller college enrollment and graduation rates have raised the question of whether the intent of Brown has been achieved. Compounding these adverse indicators of educational progress is a more serious post-&quot;Brown&quot; issue affecting all racial groups, namely, the growing gender disparity in undergraduate, graduate and professional school enrollment and attainment. The data in this article not only documents growing gender &quot;gaps&quot; within each ethnic group for bachelor's, master's, doctoral and first-professional degrees, but also confirms that women of all races have surpassed men in every degree category except first-professional degrees. Regardless of whether the disparity is an unintended consequence of &quot;Brown,&quot; this article provides some solutions to resolve this perplexing phenomenon.","Garibaldi\, Antoine M.","Desegregation Litigation,School Desegregation,Racial Differences,Gender Differences,Racial Bias,Gender Bias,Higher Education,School Segregation,Academic Persistence,Graduation Rate,Minority Group Students,High School Students,Low Achievement,College Attendance,Educational Attainment,Academic Degrees,Asian American Students,Pacific Islanders,White Students,Hispanic American Students,American Indian Students,Alaska Natives,African American Students","Journal Articles,Reports - Evaluative",2014,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

Quality was based on indicators of provisions for learning, health and safety, sensitive caregiving, and frequency of academic activities. Associations between identified quality patterns and both teacher and classroom characteristics and children's preschool and kindergarten reading and math outcomes were examined. Three patterns of quality, which varied in terms of process quality and frequency of academic (i.e., language/literacy and math/numeracy) activities, were identified.

EJ1216630,No Blacks Allowed: Segregated Gifted Education in the Context of &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;,"This article examines the under-representation of Black students in gifted education, asserting that social inequalities (e.g., prejudice and discrimination) contribute to segregated gifted education programs. Under-representation trends are presented for gifted education, along with methods for calculating under-representation and then inequity goals. Philosophically, this article is grounded in disparate impact discourse, where outcome is more cogent than intent. Denying access to gifted education based on race is immoral and illegal. Pragmatically, under-representation is couched under the larger and more comprehensive achievement gaps and inequities in school settings with implications for de jure segregation. We discuss the under-representation of Black students in gifted education with &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; as the legal foundation and then focus briefly on a recent court case in gifted education (&quot;McFadden v. Board of Education for Illinois School District U-46&quot;) for a contemporary point of discussion. Recommendations for desegregating gifted education for Black students regarding attitudes, instruments, and policies and procedures are provided.","Ford\, Donna Y.,King\, Robert A.\, Jr.","Desegregation Litigation,School Desegregation,Academically Gifted,African American Students,Disproportionate Representation,Racial Bias,Racial Discrimination,Access to Education,Equal Education,Achievement Gap,Court Litigation,Cultural Influences,Educational Equity (Finance),Enrollment Trends,Civil Rights,Teacher Competencies","Journal Articles,Reports - Evaluative",2014,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

EJ1216638,The Journey of an African American Teacher before and after &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;,"The percentage of African American educators in the U.S. has declined over the past 65 years while the public school populations have become more diverse. Reasons for this decline are posited from a review of the literature, including &quot;Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka Kansas,&quot; and the expanded opportunities for African Americans during this time period. To better understand and gain insights into possible reasons for the decline in African American educators, an oral history was completed of Miss Eileen Miller (1921-2010). Miss Miller, an African American teacher from Wheeling, West Virginia, taught in that city before, during, and after school desegregation. A discussion of her remembrances is situated in the literature and illuminates her life and career. While much is gained from the literature during the period, Miss Miller's story may well stand as an exemplar of the desegregation experience and as such deserves a place in the history as a talented educator who gracefully and powerfully managed her teaching career through many changes.","Lash\, Martha,Ratcliffe\, Monica","African American Teachers,Teaching Experience,Teacher Shortage,Educational History,Desegregation Litigation,School Desegregation,Oral History,Biographies,Personal Narratives,African American History,Equal Education","Journal Articles,Reports - Descriptive",2014,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

The study purpose was to begin the work of identifying the substance of productive behaviors among the most frequently noted population of contemporary school underachievers in order to develop an accurate hope theory for them, which the author calls African hope theory. Common threads among the participants indicate focus on racial/ethnic identity and values that lead to functional behavior. To the contrary, extant hope literature finds importance in specific goal-setting and cognitive road-mapping (planning) for achievement.

Funded by the Ford Foundation, the DLE explored how campus climate, campus policies, curricular and co-curricular environments, interplay and impact student outcomes. African Americans were the only group in the study to identify stereotypes and stereotype threat as the biggest barriers to their academic success.

In addition, prior research shows a connection between school suspension and contextual factors. However, little is understood regarding the link between contextual factors and school suspension, specifically as they relate to African Americans. The present study uses nationally representative data to assess the differential impact of contextual factors on school suspension for African Americans and Whites. The findings in this study show very few significant relationships to school suspension for African Americans as compared to Whites.

If this discrepancy is partly due to insufficient effort exerted by students, policies that aim at rewarding effort explicitly may succeed in increasing graduation rates. A unique and rich administrative dataset was used to analyze the impact of a new grading policy at Benedict College, a private historically Black college, on the college's performance and retention rates. The introduction of this policy was followed by an increase in students' cumulative grade point averages, but also by decreases in retention rates and predictive power of cognitive ability measures.","Gray\, John,Swinton\, Omari H.","Cognitive Ability,Academic Ability,Black Colleges,Grade Point Average,Academic Achievement,School Holding Power,Graduation Rate,Grade Prediction,Dropouts,Program Effectiveness,Predictor Variables,Dropout Rate,Achievement Tests,Standardized Tests,College Entrance Examinations,Enrollment,African American Students","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2017,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

The careers of two of the most well-known American Black educators illustrate this pattern. Booker T. Washington and Geoffrey Canada rose to prominence in similar political circumstances and made similar choices that reshaped education for Black people. The defeat of Reconstruction and of the Black Power movement are the essential contexts for Washington's and Canada's respective trajectories. By examining their careers, public statements, and relationships side by side, it is argued that their educational and political ideas represent a form of free market idealism. The similarities are striking.

During this two-week statistics course, students were asked to engage in a &quot;per-formative&quot; assessment that was intentionally linked to the teacher's culture. Findings presented in this study are based on feedback from a student survey addressing the question: How did hip-hop communicate or supplement the students' learning of statistics? The results aid in explicating the alignment between culture and mathematics by altering the learning norms and pedagogical strategies that often undergird traditional teaching.","Ortiz\, Nickolaus A.,Capraro\, Mary M.,Capraro\, Robert M.","Culturally Relevant Education,African American Culture,White Students,Asian American Students,Music,High School Students,Learning Experience,Mathematics Instruction,Statistics,Student Attitudes,Formative Evaluation,Instructional Effectiveness","Journal Articles,Reports - Research,Tests/Questionnaires",2018,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

EJ1213482,"A Crusader and an Advocate: The Black Press, The Scopes Trial, and Educational Progress","The Scopes Trial was one of the most controversial, widely reported, and well-researched court cases of the twentieth century. However, historians and other researchers have largely ignored the African American community's reaction and response to the trial, leaving out valuable perspectives on this historic event. In this article, the author takes up the question: To what extent did African Americans view the Scopes Trial as an educational issue? The viewpoints of a diverse group of African Americans who participated in the evolution debate are described and analyzed, focusing specifically on newspaper and periodical columnists. In addition, the author examines how African American commentators skillfully connected questions of science and religion to larger goals of educational and racial equality.","Robinson\, Shantá R.","Newspapers,Cartoons,Social Problems,Social Justice,African Americans,Academic Achievement,Evolution,African American Community,African American Attitudes,Equal Education,Journalism,United States History,Press Opinion,Racial Discrimination,Race,Racial Attitudes,Debate","Journal Articles,Reports - Evaluative",2018,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

EJ1213485,Applying the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale for Use with Third-Year African American College Students,"Resilience is a key component in the success equation for many students attending a historically Black college or university (HBCU). Although traditional indicators of prior academic achievement are often used to predict persistence to degree completion, there is growing support for including latent non-cognitive characteristics into this model. The current study surveyed third-year African American HBCU students using the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale to gauge their existing resilience. Results indicated that the instrument was appropriate for use with this cohort, who displayed slightly higher than average resilience compared to the general population, which could have been due to the respondent's already persisting to their junior year. More research is needed to address the relationship between resilience and other socio-demographic, environmental, and institutional factors that may impact HBCU students' prior to, and across the entire range of their college career.","Debb\, Scott M.,Colson\, Darlene,Hacker\, Desideria,Park\, Kristoffer","Resilience (Psychology),Undergraduate Students,African American Students,Black Colleges,Measures (Individuals),Holistic Approach,Correlation,Academic Achievement,At Risk Students,School Holding Power,Academic Persistence","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2018,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

The authors used a comparative lens to highlight how Black women's experiences compared to Women of Color and White women, and a within-group design to contextualize Black women's experiences as a unique group. The authors also explored how Black women's racialized experiences and motivation beliefs varied across STEM and Non-STEM majors. Overall, Black women experienced a more hostile racial climate and less academic satisfaction than women from other racial/ethnic groups. Black women reported similar levels of academic competence, suggesting their determination to excel despite experiencing race-related challenges in their institutional context. Finally, racial stigmatization was negatively associated with academic motivation.","Leath\, Seanna,Chavous\, Tabbye","African American Students,Females,Racial Composition,Whites,College Environment,Racial Bias,Student Motivation,Student Experience,Racial Differences,White Students,Majors (Students),STEM Education,Student Satisfaction,Academic Ability,College Students","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2018,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

This study seeks to problematize this idea by including the intersection of children's race and gender. This article examines race and gender disparities in teachers' perceptions of children's problem behaviors and student-teacher conflict, using recent national data on kindergartners. The author finds that teachers' ratings of past problem behaviors mediate the gap in teachers' perceptions of current problem behavior and student-teacher conflict between Black girls and White boys. In contrast, non-Black girls retain their &quot;advantage&quot; over White boys. Drawing upon theories of intersectionality, the author discusses the implications of the findings for understanding the unique schooling experiences of Black girls in early childhood.","Zimmermann\, Calvin Rashaud","Females,African American Students,Kindergarten,Preschool Teachers,Preschool Children,Behavior Problems,Teacher Student Relationship,Conflict,Racial Bias,Gender Bias,Early Childhood Education,Teacher Attitudes","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2018,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

However, The Philadelphia Negro globally revolutionized social science and epidemiological research that expands far beyond sociology and the United States. This study, which was groundbreaking for its era in its implication of social, spatial, intercultural, and intracultural health determinants, authenticated the existence of racial disparities and how systemic inequalities impact health.

Dr. Freeman Hrabowski, president of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), describes key experiences that contributed to his development as an educator, including his participation as a child leader in the 1963 Children's March in Birmingham, Alabama. These experiences informed development of the university's Meyerhoff Scholars Program, which is focused on preparing students from underrepresented groups to complete STEM doctorates and pursue research careers. The approach taken in this strengths-based program has been applied broadly, both on and off campus, and it has led to the development of an institutional culture that embraces academic innovation and student success.","Hrabowski\, Freeman A.\, III","African American Students,Disproportionate Representation,Graduate Students,Educational History,Educational Trends,Scholarships,Educational Change,Universities,School Culture","Journal Articles,Reports - Descriptive",2018,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

Black teacher associations demonstrated historic agency by demanding a fundamental right to an education, equal salaries, and the right to work during the era of desegregation. Black education associations thus served as a professional bulwark against institutional racism. The agency of Black teacher associations constitutes a unique though overlooked role in civil rights history that illustrates the latent potential of teacher associations to serve as bastions of civil rights-based reform initiatives.","Hale\, Jon","African American Teachers,Teacher Associations,Geographic Regions,School Segregation,School Desegregation,Teacher Rights,Equal Education,Equal Opportunities (Jobs),Teacher Salaries,Racial Bias,Social Justice,Civil Rights,United States History,African American History,Desegregation Litigation,Court Litigation","Journal Articles,Reports - Descriptive",2018,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

EJ1213621,(Text)Mining Microaggressions Literature: Implications Impacting Black Computing Faculty,"Microaggressions are brief and commonplace daily verbal behavioral or environmental indignities (whether intentional or unintentional) that communicate hostility, insensitivity and negativity to an individual or group. Microaggressions communicate beliefs about who is expected to participate in and succeed in fields of study. Microaggressions can play a significant role in how Black faculty perceive and experience participation, engagement, retention and advancement. The authors adopt a broad definition of computing to include information systems, information sciences, and computer science. The Computer Research Association (CRA) Taulbee Survey, for instance, indicates that Black faculty represent 1.3 percent of computing sciences faculty at PhD-granting departments, and only 0.6 percent are full professors. Because Black faculty are woefully underrepresented in the field, issues of career fit and progression, institutional fit, social and professional isolation, mentoring and career support are paramount. Understanding microaggressive experiences and coping strategies will advance knowledge and facilitate the development of theoretically-informed interventions for building the resilience of Black faculty and cultivating supportive institutional environments that encourage their retention and career advancement. The authors employ &quot;big data&quot; text-mining analytic methods to uncover and explore themes related to microaggressions experienced by Black faculty as discussed in scholarly and academic publications. The results uncovered five topics (jobs and race, gender and race, family, tenure, and dialogue) and three major themes (media coverage, post-aggression, and prevalence). The authors conclude with policy and research implications of these results.","Payton\, Fay Cobb,Yarger\, Lynette (Kvasny)","Racial Bias,African American Teachers,College Faculty,Teaching Conditions,Computer Science Education,Disproportionate Representation,Coping,Mentors,Work Environment,Social Justice,Mass Media Effects","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2018,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

Du Bois, we believe that access to educational opportunities is a fundamental right that should be provided to all Americans, regardless of race, ethnicity, or national origin. Too often, however, the educational experiences for Black students are significantly uneven in comparison to other demographic groups. These students commonly do not have access to advanced curricula, courses, programs, facilities, and teachers--important factors regarded as the hallmark for receiving a quality pre-K-12 education. To this end, the authors critically investigated the under-representation of Black students in gifted and talented programs in the United States. Using data from the 2015-16 Office for Civil Rights, Civil Rights Data Collection, the authors discovered, again, negative gifted and talented trends among Black students, suggesting that racial discrimination and bias may significantly contribute to their low participation in such advanced academic programs.

These colleges have been celebrated for their achievements and critiqued for their composition at differing points during their collective history. This article addresses contemporary ebbs and flows of their relevance and reputation in the national discourse. Particular attention is given to real or perceived changes in the status and place of these institutions since the election of President Barack Obama and the new imperative for maintaining institutional significance.

The authors found that many of them were engaged in efforts to address problems of race through education--the education of their own students, of those in other teacher preparation programs, of in-service teachers, and of students in K-12 schools. In addition, Teachers College graduates took on leadership roles at various levels in Black education, extending social reconstructionism to colleges and school districts from Harlem to the South.","McCarthy\, Mary Rose,Murrow\, Sonia E.","Educational History,African American Education,Progressive Education,United States History,Schools of Education,Periodicals,Racial Discrimination,Equal Education,Preservice Teacher Education,Teacher Education Programs,Social Change,Rural Education,Graduate Students,Social Justice","Journal Articles,Reports - Descriptive",2013,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

EJ1010783,The Same... But Different: Examining Background Characteristics among Black Males in Public Two-Year Colleges,"This study examined background characteristics among Black males in public two-year and four-year institutions. This study sought to uncover whether significant differences existed among this sub-group by institutional type. Data were derived from 533 Black male students participating in the Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study. The analysis was conducted using two stages of logit analysis. In the first stage, individual logistic regressions were conducted with eighteen variables. In the second stage, significant variables from the first stage were analyzed using appropriate controls. Findings from this study illustrated that Black males at two year colleges are markedly different from those attending four year institutions. Even when statistical controls were set in place, findings illustrated that while Black males share the same racial/ethnic and gender identity there are numerous distinctions between institutional types on background variables. Implications for future research are delineated. (Contains 3 tables.)","Wood\, J.

The researcher conducted interviews with both participants, and analyzed the data verbatim uncovering these four themes: (a) college preparedness, (b) high aspirations and goals, (c) social connections and relationships, and (d) growth through student organizational commitment. The study found that components of PE support African American male persistence.

The statistical study of 190 African American males attending five research universities reveals that successful African American males report a heightened sense of self-efficacy and were more satisfied with opportunities to interact with faculty. Black males with higher GPAs in college also report higher levels of faculty and social integration, though the relationship is moderated by their racial identity attitudes.

Findings suggested that schools were social and academic environments where education was valued.

EJ1010793,African American Homeschooling and the Question of Curricular Cultural Relevance,"Homeschooling, and academic interest in this phenomenon, have increased tremendously over the last decade. The surge of African American involvement in the homeschool movement has also become noticeable. However, there continues to be a general paucity of research on the motivations of African American parents that choose homeschooling. In order to capture the voice of African American homeschoolers, the authors conducted seventy-four interviews in the spring and summer of 2010 in several large U.S. metropolitan areas. The findings revealed that curricular considerations play a critical part, since many African American homeschoolers believe that a Eurocentric curriculum is bound to gravely interfere with their children's self-esteem and sense of purpose.

EJ1010795,Unpacking the Gender Gap in Postsecondary Participation among African Americans and Caucasians Using Hierarchical Generalized Linear Modeling,"National reports recognize a growing gender gap in postsecondary enrollment as a major challenge impacting the lives of young men, particularly African Americans. Previous gender and race specific research is largely inconclusive. It is, for example, unclear from previous research how persistent the gender gap is across various school contexts, student demographics, and process characteristics. Drawing data from National Educational Longitudinal Study, the present study uses Hierarchical Generalized Linear Modeling (HGLM) to examine both student and school level characteristics that explain variations in college enrollment among African American men and women (with Caucasians included as a contrast group). Results showed that student level characteristics including gender, socioeconomic status, and race were all significant predictors of postsecondary enrollment. Furthermore, home process characteristics (including students' consistency of postsecondary expectations and parental involvement) significantly explained college enrollment when controlling for student home background factors. When considering school level variables, only the percentage of students receiving free or reduced lunch and the percentage of minorities in the school were significant predictors of college enrollment above and beyond what was contributed at the student level, that is, student background and home process factors.

Yet, preschools, elementary schools, and families often differ in their beliefs about salient abilities. The degree of alignment among teachers and parents influences how successfully children make the transition to kindergarten. Focusing on one inner-city neighborhood and using qualitative interviews, the authors examine preschool teachers', kindergarten teachers', and low-income African American mothers' school readiness beliefs. African American teachers from Head Start and charter and neighborhood schools emphasized academic and socio-emotional skills. Their views were consonant with mothers of preschoolers. Montessori teachers differed from mothers in their emphasis on socio-emotional skills. Teachers' beliefs were related to school type, curricula, and teacher tenure and race. Mothers' beliefs reflected racial background. These findings contribute to research on home-school collaborations and offer recommendations for promoting home-school alignments.","Jarrett\, Robin L.,Coba-Rodriguez\, Sarai","School Readiness,Low Income Students,African American Students,Preschool Teachers,Kindergarten,Preschool Education,Teacher Attitudes,Mothers,Parent Attitudes,Urban Schools,Early Intervention,Charter Schools,Neighborhood Schools,Social Development,Emotional Development,Academic Ability,Montessori Method,Institutional Characteristics,Curriculum,Teaching Experience,Racial Differences","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2019,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

EJ1285367,Black Males Who Hold Advanced Degrees: Critical Factors That Preclude and Promote Success,"Historical analyses of educational attainment trends have revealed disparities concerning Black males, particularly with respect to attainment of advanced degrees. The purpose of the present study was to identify critical factors that promoted educational attainment of advanced degrees among ten Black men who were leaders within educational organizations and had earned at least one advanced degree. The present study was grounded in understandings related to social cognitive theory and considered the distinctiveness of the Black male experience. Using a phenomenological qualitative research design, data were analyzed using a grounded theory approach, which led to the identification of three themes: (1) supportive social networks; (2) aspects of cultural identity; and (3) self-beliefs. A discussion of findings summarized favorable and unfavorable critical factors that emerged from data analyses and pointed to implications for graduate program stakeholders regarding educational resilience and leaders within educational organizations regarding the recruitment, retention, and development of Black male leaders. Recommendations for future areas of research were provided, as well as limitations with the present study.","Scott\, Lawrence,Sharp\, Laurie A.","African Americans,Males,College Graduates,Masters Degrees,Doctoral Degrees,Influences,Educational Attainment,Social Networks,Self Concept,Cultural Influences","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2019,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

EJ1285368,The Effect of Western Formal Education on the Ghanaian Educational System and Cultural Identity,"Prior to the arrival of Europeans in the 15th century, informal education existed in Ghana with the goal of introducing young people into the society. The traditions and values of the community, as well as the meaning of life, were taught to the child. By using postcolonial theory as a framework for analysis, it is evident that the Western formal education introduced to the people of the Gold Coast by the Christian missionaries and the British Colonial government did not serve the indigenous population well. Rather, it denationalized and facilitated the indignity and loss of cultural identity of the Ghanaian. The missionary and colonial education aimed at character training and civilization resulted in cultural annihilation and religious, and linguistic hegemony.","Pinto\, Ransford","Foreign Countries,Informal Education,Foreign Policy,Western Civilization,Cultural Influences,Educational History,Educational Development,Religious Factors,Government Role,Elementary Secondary Education,Higher Education,Christianity","Journal Articles,Reports - Evaluative",2019,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

EJ1285376,&quot;Sounds Like Something a White Man Should Be Doing&quot;: The Shared Experiences of Black Women Engineering Students,"Black women engineering students often find themselves in an uninviting space in a field dominated by White men. Thus, as Black women matriculate toward completion of their engineering degrees, they encounter instances of racism, sexism, and prejudice that result from the intersection of their race and gender. In an effort to identify and understand their similar experiences, the present study used Black feminist theory and intersectionality. Nine undergraduate Black women engineering students at a predominantly White institution engaged in semi-structured life history interviews. The interviews revealed two themes that exposed how others view participants, how participants view themselves, the similarities among Black women engineering students' experiences, the different ways Black women can be oppressed, and the ways in which Black women experience and respond to different forms of prejudice.","Stitt\, Rashunda L.,Happel-Parkins\, Alison","African American Students,Females,Engineering Education,Disproportionate Representation,Racial Bias,Gender Bias,Student Experience,Student Attitudes,Self Concept,STEM Education,College Students,Stereotypes","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2019,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

While Black students hold high aspirations for future success, their college and career readiness in literacy is often mitigated by instructional barriers in K-8 classrooms. In this article, the author offers a set of principles, inspired by the work of the late Brazilian educator Paulo Freire that teachers can use to enhance Black students' college and career readiness. The treatise outlines four instructional principles that help Black students critically &quot;read the word and the world&quot;: (a) Leverage students' community knowledge and career aspirations for literacy skill instruction; (b) Center students' racial literacies and conventional literacies within instruction; (c) Promote liberatory literacies through conventional, creative, and critical writing; and (d) Inspire skill development, critique, and action through &quot;problem-posing&quot; projects.","Turner\, Jennifer D.","African American Students,College Readiness,Career Readiness,Elementary Schools,Middle Schools,Barriers,Literacy Education,Teaching Methods,Racial Bias,Equal Education,Culturally Relevant Education,Creativity,Skill Development","Journal Articles,Reports - Descriptive",2019,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

A stepwise multiple-regression analysis revealed that depression and being a freshman, respectively, were predictors of internet addiction. Chi-square tests showed that there was significant positive association between internet addiction and depression, while internet addiction was negatively associated with resilience. These findings provide useful information for developing culturally tailored interventions of internet addiction for African American college students especially who are depressed and not resilient in their first year.","Jin\, Seok Won,Jones\, Tiffanie-Victoria,Lee\, Yeonggeul","African American Students,College Students,Resilience (Psychology),Depression (Psychology),Addictive Behavior,Internet,Computer Use,Predictor Variables,College Freshmen,Gender Differences,Black Colleges","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2019,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

Using interviews and narrative to capture her first-hand perspective as a woman engineer of color, peer support was revealed as a dominant factor in her attainment of a PhD in engineering. The two counter-stories presented are related to positive and negative peer support in STEM. These narratives serve as valid evidence for one woman's experiences in STEM and emphasize the role of race and racism on peer networks and STEM success.

As such, Black male perspectives regarding the ways in which they support each other in successfully navigating these fundamentally racist, hostile, and exclusive spaces are often missing from or under-discussed in the extant literature. This idea is particularly true for Black males who are members of Black Greek-lettered organizations whose experiences are often tainted by negative media and popular press surrounding hazing, death, and other types of malfeasance. Drawing on Lynn's notion of &quot;otherfathering,&quot; the purpose of this article is to propose what the authors term &quot;otherbrothering&quot; and &quot;otherbrothers&quot; not only to locate the ways in which Black male collegians provide networks of support to assist each other in navigating PWIs but also to highlight the positive purposes of these organizations.

EJ1286022,How the Grantsperson Identity of HBCU Computer Science Faculty Shape Efforts to Broaden the Participation of Black People in Tech,"A &quot;grantsperson&quot; is a ubiquitous, elusive and debated identity in higher education that describes a person who is proficient in competing for external funding to support research and programs. Historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) receive less revenue for computer science research and programs, which could have consequences for national efforts to broaden the participation of Black people in tech. The purpose of this investigation is to explore the grantsperson identity among HBCU computer science faculty and how it shapes the experiences of Black computer science students. This research is based on the findings of focus groups that explored HBCU computer science professors' experiences with pursuing external funding including factors that facilitated and/or inhibited the process. Participants included faculty with diverse perspectives and institutional experiences representing 15 HBCUs from eight states and the District of Columbia. The findings of this study provided six themes, which can be used to create a profile of an HBCU-based computer science grantsperson.","Toldson\, Ivory A.,Mugo\, Mercy,Wofford\, Nyla","Grantsmanship,Fund Raising,College Faculty,African American Teachers,Computer Science Education,Black Colleges,Profiles,Federal Aid,Grants,Barriers,Racial Bias,Institutional Characteristics,Teacher Responsibility","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2019,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

They assessed how the items were related to each other, how SSNS versions correlated with each other, and the SSNS versions associations with measures of student attitudes and performance. Eighty students from a historically Black college and university participated. SSNS 10-item- and 5-item-per-scale forms were created. They were compared with the original, to each other, and to other measures. The coefficients related to how items related to each other indicated that the alternative forms had similar to better correspondence between related items than the original scales. The 5-item-per-scale version was used as the augmented SSNS (SSNS-A). SSNS-A correlations with measures of student attitudes and performance were generally in the expected direction. Implications are discussed in regard to reliability and validity of the SSNS-A.","Gross\, Thomas J.,Li\, Qingxia,Lockwood\, Adam B.","Black Colleges,College Students,Student Needs,Test Construction,Test Validity,Test Reliability,STEM Education,Academic Persistence,School Holding Power,Test Items,Academic Support Services,Student Personnel Services,Measures (Individuals),Knowledge Level,Performance,Student Motivation,Educational Resources,Feedback (Response),Self Efficacy","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2019,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

EJ1286028,Examining the Role of Scientific Identity in Black Student Retention in a STEM Scholar Program,"This study reports on early program retention in a multi-component undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) scholar program aimed at diversifying STEM at a large, research-intensive, predominantly White university. The authors drew on London and associates' STEM Engagement Framework to determine what factors are related to remaining in the program through the first two years. Results indicate that having a high scientific identity and reporting fewer instances of discrimination increased the likelihood of remaining in the program. Black students were somewhat more likely than the other underrepresented racially minoritized (URM) groups to remain in the program and were as likely as non-URM participants to remain enrolled in the program.","Oseguera\, Leticia,Park\, Hyun Ju,De Los Rios\, Maria Javiera,Aparicio\, Elyzza M.,Johnson\, Royel","Role,Identification (Psychology),Science Education,Self Concept,African American Students,School Holding Power,STEM Education,Disproportionate Representation,Program Effectiveness","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2019,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

Such knowledge can inform efforts to recruit and retain URM students in STEM. The authors asked postsecondary URM STEM students to describe the characteristics that they (1) have in common and (2) do not have in common with scientists, as well as experiences that made them feel like scientists. In this article, the authors present a composite of a URM STEM student's science identity--the first of its kind--and discuss the implications of this perceived science identity for the recruitment and retention of URM STEM students.","Nealy\, Schetema,Orgill\, MaryKay","College Students,Minority Group Students,Disproportionate Representation,STEM Education,Student Attitudes,Identification (Psychology),Student Characteristics,Personality Traits,Science Education,Self Concept","Journal Articles,Reports - Research,Tests/Questionnaires",2019,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

EJ1286093,"(Re)Creating the Script: A Framework of Agency, Accountability, and Resisting Deficit Depictions of Black Students in P-20 Education","Historically, education research and practice has failed to accentuate the factors that promote Black student success and, instead, produced deficit-centered narratives that focused on Black students' academic underachievement and challenges. These dominant narratives have negatively influenced Black students' experiences and there is a need for an alternate lens that does not reduce the Black academic experience to one of challenge and underperformance. As various stakeholders work to unhinge inequitable power structures within education, it is important that we critically examine the ways in which current education research and practice perpetuate narratives rooted in racist logic. Accordingly, this article interrogates that question and examines how historical racial biases continue to afflict Black students. Also, the authors examine research concerning Black student agency as a counter to marginalizing depictions. Furthermore, conceptual guidance (i.e., The Aftermath Framework) is offered to identify, challenge, and disrupt the continuation of majoritarian narratives concerning Black students, which often restrict opportunity structures and Black students' overarching educational trajectories.","Williams\, Krystal L.,Coles\, Justin A.,Reynolds\, Patrick","Preschool Education,Elementary Secondary Education,Postsecondary Education,African American Students,Racial Bias,Negative Attitudes,Accountability,Educational Research,Educational History,Racial Discrimination,United States History,Curriculum,Equal Education,Ethnic Stereotypes,Student Empowerment,Social Capital,Social Justice,Whites,Social Attitudes","Journal Articles,Reports - Evaluative",2020,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

The authors addressed this gap in the literature by examining the relationships between formal mentoring program participation, science identity salience, and graduate school enrollment in a sample of first-generation, low-income, underrepresented students. Specifically, interest was in understanding whether these relationships are the same for first-generation, low-income students, underrepresented students; and what aspects of a formal mentoring program are most important for graduate school enrollment in this group. These relationships were explored using data from The Science Study, a national panel study of undergraduate STEM majors.","Piatt\, Elizabeth,Merolla\, David,Pringle\, Eboni,Serpe\, Richard T.","STEM Education,Professional Identity,Self Concept,Mentors,Program Effectiveness,Correlation,Enrollment Influences,Educational Attainment,Graduate Study,Student Participation,Undergraduate Students,First Generation College Students,Low Income Students,African American Students,Hispanic American Students,Disproportionate Representation","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2019,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

EJ1286116,Black Women in STEM: The Need for Intersectional Supports in Professional Conference Spaces,"National discourse about STEM careers has dominated conversations about the need to meet the demands of the labor market. The ever increasing population diversity requires the participation of underrepresented groups, including women and individuals from racially minoritized backgrounds. However, for those at the intersections of historical and persistent marginality, such as Black female students, access to STEM majors, programs, and careers are particularly limited. This article uses observations, four student focus groups, document analysis, and survey data from a Black science conference to understand the experiences of Black women student attendees. Through an intersectional lens, we find that professional conferences can better serve Black female student participants by considering their nuanced experiences, barriers, and contributions to the field. We thank the National Science Foundation for supporting the conference and data collection used in this project.","Sanchez\, Mabel E.,Hypolite\, Liane I.,Newman\, Christopher B.,Cole\, Darnell G.","College Students,African American Students,Disproportionate Representation,Females,STEM Education,Professional Associations,Conferences (Gatherings),Student Participation,Barriers,Feminism,Science Departments","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2019,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

Students who are deaf or hard of hearing require access to resources; however, integrated support in the college environment remains a concept for further discussion. Retention of these students may be less influenced by the student's ability to perform academically and more influenced by the level of support provided. The support needs of students who are hard of hearing are defined according to educational needs, resources, social interaction, emotional intelligence, and the ability to cope with independence and isolation from familiar communities. In this context, the academic success of students of color who are deaf or hard of hearing relates directly to colleges' abilities to promote supportive systems particularly during the transition to college life.","Thompson-Ochoa\, Danielle","School Holding Power,Minority Group Students,College Students,Deafness,Hearing Impairments,Educational Strategies,Student Needs","Journal Articles,Reports - Descriptive",2020,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

EJ1286231,&quot;They Just Hang Out with Their Own:&quot; Organized Racial Inequality in a Rural Southern High School,"Using interview and observational data in one rural southern high school, this study explores how students are organized by race and how they negotiate those arrangements in predominantly Black school context. Although predominantly Black schools can provide safe spaces for Black students to thrive socially and academically without suspicion of criminality, this study reveals that they can also contain demeaning disciplinary treatment and exclusion from predominantly White learning spaces and dances. The findings thus expose racial disparity in students' spatial, academic, and disciplinary organization, as well as the consequences for reproducing racial inequality in students' social lives. From academics to discipline, students' racially stratified positions in school reflect a historical legacy of limiting Black students' physical movement and intellectual opportunity.","Riel\, Virginia","Rural Schools,High Schools,High School Students,Peer Relationship,Racial Relations,Racial Bias,Racial Differences,Group Membership,Social Life,Social Stratification,Discipline","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2020,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

EJ1286232,"Being vs. Becoming: Transcending STEM Identity Development through Afropessimism, Moving toward a Black X Consciousness in STEM","Research investigating Black student engagement in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) postsecondary education connects their racial identity to STEM identity development and persistence. How Black students perceive and understand their Blackness in relationship to STEM learning environments to embody their identity; however, are not fully illuminated. This study presents insights from 44 Black undergraduate students studying STEM at a predominantly White institution (PWI). Using phenomenological focus group interviews, analyzed through the Afropessimist principles of the afterlife of slavery and anti-Blackness, the authors find that Black students' rationale for coping mechanisms employed is shaped by individualism and Black collectivism. They name this rationale &quot;Black X Consciousness,&quot; and provide implications for its importance in Black student STEM education research.","Morton\, Terrell R.,Gee\, Destiny S.,Woodson\, Ashley N.","African American Students,STEM Education,Identification (Psychology),Student Participation,Racial Identification,Racial Factors,Undergraduate Students,Cultural Influences,Coping,Individualism,Collectivism,Stereotypes","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2019,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

Drawing from seminal literature on teacher preparation, this conceptual manuscript examined microaffirmations as a culturally relevant approach for K-12 instruction. The authors highlight the intersections of instructional climate and instruction in English Language Arts as compared to classical literature regarding student affirming theoretical frameworks to contextualize engaging pedagogy. The findings suggest that within classrooms, microaffirmations have the ability to significantly affect both student and teacher development. The implications and recommendations are provided to strengthen the use of microaffirmation approaches to support academic growth for K-12 underserved student populations.","Samuels\, Shalander,Wilkerson\, Amanda,Chapman\, DeShawn,Watkins\, Whitney","Culturally Relevant Education,Academic Achievement,Elementary Secondary Education,Minority Group Students,Teacher Education,Language Arts,Classroom Techniques,Classroom Environment,Educational Technology,Cultural Awareness","Journal Articles,Reports - Evaluative",2020,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

Throughout this study, I maintain that a careful analysis of social justice must consider the culture and mission of the institution for which it exists.

Racial identity development is often a lifelong journey, but less is known about the role of BCCs in this process during college. This ethnographic study offers how a BCC at a historically White institution (HWI) functions for Black students as they explore their racial identity as a potential strategy for strengthening campus engagement.

While they appreciated the school, many parents were worried about communication related to their children's academic performance, and to access to, and necessity for, academic tutoring. Underlying their concern was a fear about Black children being asked to leave the school. Parents drew upon community cultural wealth and adopted racial realist views to navigate these concerns. Race and class intersected in the ways parents perceived and responded to their experiences. The study reveals how the school systemically disadvantaged Black students. The authors suggest how teachers and administrators can disrupt practices that contribute to White dominance.","Bolgatz\, Jane,Crowley\, Ryan,Figueroa\, Enrique","Parent Attitudes,Blacks,African American Students,Student Experience,Elementary School Students,Private Schools,Critical Theory,Race,Racial Bias,Academic Achievement,Cultural Capital,Realism,Whites,Institutional Characteristics,Disproportionate Representation,Racial Discrimination,Tutoring,Parent School Relationship","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2020,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

EJ878414,I Cannot Read My Statistics Textbook: The Relationship between Reading Ability and Statistics Anxiety,"Although several antecedents of statistics anxiety have been identified, many of these factors are relatively immutable (e.g., gender) and, at best, identify students who are at risk for debilitative levels of statistics anxiety, thereby having only minimal implications for intervention. Furthermore, the few interventions that have been designed to reduce students' levels of anxiety have tended to be teacher-centered rather than student-centered. The area of reading ability appears to offer a viable avenue for research on the antecedents of statistics anxiety. Because statistics textbooks often present complex material, students with low-reading ability likely are prone to experience high anxiety levels. However, to date, this link has not been formally investigated. Thus, this study examined whether reading ability predicts statistics anxiety levels among 92 African American graduate students enrolled in a historically Black college and university (HBCU). Findings revealed a strong multivariate relationship between reading ability and statistic anxiety. Implications are discussed. (Contains 2 tables.)","Collins\, Kathleen M.

EJ878416,Rising above Reality: The Voices of Reentry Black Mothers and Their Daughters,"This article examines the following three themes present in the educational narratives of a group of Black reentry (returning to college) mothers: (a) reentry as a response to a critical moment, (b) reentry as a strategy for coping with challenges, and (c) reentry as a practical step toward getting their daughters into college. Cursory reviews of Black women in higher education and representations of Black motherhood contextualize the struggles these and other Black women have faced in getting an education, raising their families, and maintaining a positive image. The daughters' voices are included to provide a clearer picture of the effect a Black mother's reentry can have on her children--particularly her daughters--who are the next generation of females in her family.

EJ878418,The Effects of School Racial and Ethnic Composition on Academic Achievement during Adolescence,"This research examines the effects of school racial and ethnic composition on students' academic achievement in the U.S. using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and hierarchical linear models. This analysis includes Hispanics, which stands apart from other research in this area that has traditionally focused on only Black and White student racial composition. In addition, peer group influences are measured by utilizing the comprehensive peer network data available for all respondents in the sample. Interactions between individual race/ethnicity and school racial/ethnic composition are also tested to better understand the possible differential effects of racial/ethnic composition for each race/ethnicity. The results show that school and peer racial/ethnic composition has important effects on individual level achievement.

EJ878419,Stepping outside the Master Script: Re-Connecting the History of American Education,"Inaccurate and incomplete presentations of American education history in teacher education programs play a central role in the poor preparation of pre-service teachers. This article exemplifies how the praxis of late 19th and 20th century African descent educators--who viewed education as a vehicle for freedom and an affirmation of humanity--informed the democratic agenda claimed by their White counterparts. This informing praxis has been hidden in master scripted accounts of the history of American education through a White/normative belief structure of race, which has created a disconnection between emancipatory African descent educators and White reform-minded educators to this day.","Swartz\, Ellen","Educational History,Misconceptions,Preservice Teacher Education,Teacher Education Programs,Disproportionate Representation,African Americans,Time Perspective,African American Teachers,Educational Change,Social Structure,Social Justice,World Views,Role of Education,Whites,Perspective Taking","Journal Articles,Reports - Evaluative",2007,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

EJ878420,Racial Identity and Black Students' Perceptions of Community Outreach: Implications for Bonding Social Capital,"This research investigates the impact of racial identity on Black students' perceptions of community outreach. Colleges and universities are steadily forming university-community partnerships. Research has not fully addressed those indicators that may influence relationship-forming between Black students and Black community members. The sample includes 276 Black students who attended either a historically Black college and university (HBCU) or a predominantly White institution (PWI). Hierarchical regression analyses found that the Black racial identity scale's (B-RIAS) pre-encounter stage negatively predicted and a combination of the immersion-emersion and internalization stages positively predicted community outreach. This study has implications for shaping university-community agendas involving Black students and Black community members, and it offers a unique framework to think about Black students' civic participation.

EJ878421,Contextualizing Race: African American College Choice in an Evolving Affirmative Action Era,"Using a critical race theory framework, this study examines the ways in which race and racialized ideologies are manifested in high-stakes college admissions, the debate over affirmative action, and the college choice behavior of Black high school students. This study allows for the voices of Black high school students in California to describe their lived experiences with Proposition 209, suggesting a deeper meaning to affirmative action than simply the ways in which it affected institutional practices related to admissions decisions. The results indicate that, following the end of affirmative action in California, Black students had altered perceptions of where they were welcome and where they belonged in higher education. The results of this study can help colleges and universities to create, maintain, or improve a positive and welcoming climate for students of color in the wake of such policy changes.","Teranishi\, Robert T.,Briscoe\, Kamilah","College Choice,Ideology,Affirmative Action,College Admission,High School Students,African American Students,Critical Theory,Admission Criteria,Student Attitudes,Black Studies,Racial Identification,Interviews,Focus Groups,Participant Observation","Journal Articles,Reports - Evaluative",2008,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

EJ878422,Enhancing Cultural Competence among Teachers of African American Children Using Mediated Lesson Study,"Researchers investigated if early childhood teachers could become reflective practitioners when they studied culturally specific constructs within a digital collegial environment. Three female African American early childhood teachers within three different settings (a faith-based primary school, a home school, and a government-funded pre-school agency) developed mini-research projects using a mediated form of ""Lesson Study"". Data consisted of teachers' electronic mail, application artifacts, synchronous and asynchronous online activities via Blackboard, and videotaped exit interviews. Findings showed that even when there is ethnic congruence, teachers are inclined to teach in ways that propagate the Eurocentric curriculum model. The teachers' use of a culturally-specific reflective teaching model resulted in culturally responsive teaching practices within their individual classrooms.

This study compared African American VR access before the antidiscrimination legislation in 1937 and after the legislation in 2004. Using Rehabilitation Services Administration Case Service Report data released in 2004, the study duplicated a 1938 study that examined African Americans' access to VR in 1937. It analyzed 441,153 cases from the 2004 report to determine: access, types of services rendered, relative expenditures, and VR intervention outcomes for White and for African American consumers. The study found widening gaps between White and African American consumers in education, employment, earnings, and in per capita VR expenditures for services rendered. The 2004 data indicated that a proportionately larger number of African American consumers were closed out as applicants or for ""failure to cooperate"" or ""unable to locate.""

EJ878424,Racial and Ethnic-Related Stressors as Predictors of Perceived Stress and Academic Performance for African American Students at a Historically Black College and University,"The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether racial and ethnic-related stressors were associated with overall levels of perceived stress and academic performance among African American students at a historically Black college and university (HBCU). Hierarchical regression analyses were used to test racial and ethnic-related stressors and background variables as predictors of general levels of perceived stress and academic performance (i.e., grade point average). The results of the regression analyses revealed that gender, age, and Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores were significant predictors of perceived stress. However, racial and ethnic-related stressors were the strongest predictors of perceived stress, over and above gender, age, and SAT scores. In predicting academic performance, SAT scores were the only significant predictors, while racial and ethnic-related stressors were not significant predictors of this outcome. Implications of these findings and suggestions for future research are discussed.

EJ878426,Creating Schools where Race Does Not Predict Achievement: The Role and Significance of Race in the Racial Achievement Gap,"This article explores the ways in which race is implicated in efforts to address the achievement gap in U.S. schools. Through an analysis of the theoretical and historical issues that have framed the relationship between race and intellectual ability, the author explains why the effort to close the achievement gap is politically and socially significant. The efforts of two suburban school districts to address the achievement gap is presented to illustrate why some schools are making progress in closing the achievement gap while others are not. These cases are used to make a call for a new discourse about the role of race in student achievement and to clarify how and why race continues to be so controversial and confounding to educators who are working to ensure that all children, regardless of their backgrounds, receive a quality education and have the opportunity to experience academic success.","Noguera\, Pedro A.","Suburban Schools,Race,Academic Achievement,Educational Quality,Racial Differences,Achievement Gap,Educational History,School Districts,Role,Educational Environment","Journal Articles,Reports - Evaluative",2008,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

The critical ethnographic research approach used in this study revealed that there was real student disengagement during the learning process. The article pointed out the historical base of blaming students for disengagement in the educational processes in the classroom and their other untenable behaviors.

EJ878440,Powerful Pedagogy: Learning Communities at Historically Black Colleges and Universities,A recent deluge of national studies and reports warns the United States that our future hangs in the balance because our educational system is failing our society. These studies cite projections that American competitiveness is at risk because we have failed to address a growing demographic inevitability--that the segment of the population that is growing the fastest is comprised of those students who are most at risk in our educational system.

EJ878447,Consequences of Conservatism: Black Male Undergraduates and the Politics of Historically Black Colleges and Universities,"Previous research has highlighted numerous ways in which historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) offer more supportive educational environments for Black students than do predominantly White institutions (PWIs). Notwithstanding the consistency of these findings, persistence and graduation rates remain low for undergraduates, especially men, at HBCUs. Furthermore, anecdotal reports and news stories have called attention to the conservative politics of many Black colleges. This study explores how Black male students characterize, respond to, and make sense of environmental politics at 12 HBCUs that participated in the National Black Male College Achievement Study. In addition to 2-3 hour face-to-face individual interviews with 76 undergraduates, documents from 103 HBCUs were analyzed to gather additional insights into the political press of these institutions. Conservatism was evident in the areas of sexuality and sexual orientation, student self-presentation and expression, and the subordinate status of students beneath faculty and administrators.","Harper\, Shaun R.,Gasman\, Marybeth","Graduation Rate,Political Attitudes,Black Colleges,Sexual Orientation,Sexuality,Males,African American Students,Undergraduate Students,Educational Environment,Academic Persistence,Racial Factors,Politics of Education,Interviews,Power Structure","Journal Articles,Reports - Evaluative",2008,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

Results are presented from a sample of 238 African American adolescents aged 13-19 with a mean age of 15.6 years. Results suggested that youth with unfavorable attitudes toward deviance and who spend time involved in family activities are more likely to report above-average grades. As youth involvement in antisocial behavior and exposure to delinquent peers increased, they were less likely to report above-average grades. This investigation highlights the importance of examining family, peer, and individual correlates when assessing factors that influence academic performance among African American students living in public housing or similar urban settings.

However, researchers, policymakers, educators, and other stakeholders have yet to consistently identify programs and interventions that can mediate the inequities that confront young Black men. Some researchers have indicated that youth development programs can provide unique supportive educational and social opportunities for young Black males and other urban youth. In this study, the authors used qualitative analyses and ethnographic research techniques to examine the influence of an intergenerational urban youth development program on three young Black men. After more than a year of observation and several hours of interviews, three young men aged 16, 19, and 23 years old provided a vivid account of how this youth development program influenced their lives. Analyses were focused on three central questions: (a) what attracted these young men to this program, (b) why did they continue to attend the program, and (c) what perceived benefits did they receive from the program?","Woodland\, Malcolm H.,Martin\, Justin F.,Hill\, R.

EJ878478,"""Say It Loud--I'm Black and I'm Proud"": Parents' Messages about Racial Discrimination, and Academic Achievement in African American Boys","This study uses two waves of data to examine the relationships among racial socialization, racial discrimination, and academic achievement outcomes in a sample of 144 African American male adolescents. Using latent class analyses, the authors identified four patterns of adolescent-reported racial socialization experiences: Positive Socialization, Moderate Negative, Self-Worth, and Low Frequency. Discrimination experiences were associated with subsequent academic performance. Wave 1 racial socialization experiences were associated with academic persistence and performance at Wave 2. These findings suggest that various patterns of racial socialization practices have the potential to improve educational outcomes for African American boys, particularly in the context of their experiences with racial discrimination.

While previous research has produced similar results, the present study indicates there are differences in which academic beliefs and parenting behaviors are most effective in facilitating school readiness and early achievement. Emphasizing the importance of academic skills for African American boys was associated with higher reading and mathematics achievement as well as prior enrollment in center-based child care. Parenting behaviors, such as discussing science topics, reading books, and discussing family racial and ethnic heritage, differed in their significance in predicting cognitive outcomes. Implications for differences in the kinds of parental involvement in the education of African American boys are discussed.

EJ878480,Mentoring Urban Black Middle School Male Students: Implications for Academic Achievement,"Researchers have called for innovative and culturally responsive intervention programs to enhance male, Black middle school students' academic achievement. Mentoring has received considerable attention as a novel remedy. Although anecdotal evidence supports the positive role of mentoring on academic achievement, these results are not consistent. The Benjamin E. Mays Institute (BEMI) builds on the ideals of mentoring to counter the effects of academic underachievement among adolescent Black males by building a model that is Afrocentric; uses prosocial modeling; and emphasizes cultural strengths and pride, and single-sex instruction in a dual-sex educational environment. From a sample of sixty-one middle school Black males, results revealed that students in the BEMI program had significantly greater academic attachment scores and academic success than their non-mentored peers. Additionally, racial identity attitudes of immersion/emersion and internalization and identification with academics were also significantly associated with standardized achievement tests and GPA. Policy and practice implications are discussed.

EJ878483,Cultural Considerations in the Development of School-Based Interventions for African American Adolescent Boys with Emotional and Behavioral Disorders,"African American males are overrepresented among youth in special education identified as having emotional and behavioral disorders. Compared to other youth in special education, they have the least access to needed services and the worst social and academic outcomes. Little empirically supported guidance exists to inform the development of effective and culturally responsive interventions for these youth. This article addresses this gap in the literature by reviewing existing research, and highlighting problems with current approaches to identification, referral, and treatment. The authors provide specific examples about ways to harness African American adolescents' strengths when developing culturally responsive, school-based interventions and discuss implications for educational policy.","Serpell\, Zewelanji,Hayling\, Charlayne C.,Stevenson\, Howard C.,Kern\, Lee","Behavior Disorders,Educational Policy,Special Education,African American Students,Males,Disproportionate Representation,Culturally Relevant Education,Disability Identification,Intervention,Emotional Problems,Special Needs Students,Access to Education,Cultural Influences","Journal Articles,Reports - Descriptive",2009,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

A preschool to prison pipeline now exists that is becoming increasingly apparent. It runs from preschool settings through elementary and middle school, into the high schools from which young African American men continue to drop out in staggering numbers, and ultimately, into federal and state prisons. A number of critical factors affect the status of African American boys in early childhood education. They include quality of preschool setting; teacher beliefs, expectations, and behavior; acquisition of early literacy and school readiness skills; and curriculum quality and relevance. In order to address these issues and the broader context of early childhood education for African American boys, a wide range of recommendations are made for consideration by communities and policymakers.

EJ878487,Investigating whether and when Family Ethnic/Race Socialization Improves Academic Performance,"This study examined the link between family ethnic/race socialization and Black kindergarteners' and first graders' academic performance as measured by their general knowledge, math, and reading assessment scores. Drawing on identity theory, the authors predicted that repeated instances of family ethnic/race socialization would increase academic performance by affirming self-schemas and preparing young Black children for racialized experiences. Survey data used to address the prediction were nationally representative and longitudinal, and gathered as part of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K). Results showed that routine family ethnic/race socialization was associated with high assessment scores from kindergarten to first grade. Overall identity theory was supported but certain results were unexpected. For example, there was evidence of a curvilinear relationship between family ethnic/race socialization and academic performance where too infrequent or frequent socialization had negligible impact.

S. schools, which have a primarily White teaching force but an increasingly non-White student population, students and teachers may not be able to complete caring encounters based on their differing communication patterns. Therefore, it is important to understand what behaviors students view as caring so that teachers can complete caring encounters with their students. This research investigated differences in 825 sixth-grade students' perceptions of teacher caring based on student minority status. The findings of this research demonstrate that care does look different to different groups of students. Therefore, teachers must care for their students in culturally congruent ways if all students are to receive the benefits of caring teacher-student relationships.

This article questions the term ""achievement gap"" and its implication that White students perform better on standardized tests due to greater effort and ability. The term ""receivement gap"" is offered as an alternative due to its focus on structures, not students, and inputs instead of outputs. Evidence is drawn from a qualitative project using a case study design with seven African American high school students in tracked mathematics and English classes. Results indicated differential treatment by differential treatment by school personnel as early as elementary school that influenced students' later school performance. Accordingly, research supports the recommended term ""receivement gap,"" which is offered in the hope of inspiring a deeper and more nuanced discussion of factors that influence student achievement and distort the achievement of African American students.","Chambers\, Terah Venzant","African American Students,Standardized Tests,Academic Achievement,Racial Differences,Educational Change,Accountability,School Personnel,White Students,Achievement Gap,Standards,High School Students,Track System (Education),Case Studies,Mathematics,English,Language Arts","Journal Articles,Reports - Evaluative",2009,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

While some funds for educational R&amp;D were available after World War II, a significant amount of federal support became available during the years following the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education ruling which outlawed de jure public school segregation. After that ruling, the eyes of the nation were opened to the discrepancy between Black and White student academic achievement, as well as the significant economic disparity that existed between the races. Programs such as Title I and Head Start were established under major federal legislation passed in the 1960s. These programs were designed to help address the academic discrepancies and economic disparities between the races. New entities were also established in the 1960s, referred to as Educational Research and Development Centers and Regional Educational Laboratories (RELs).

Drawing on data from a yearlong qualitative investigation, the author discusses how the use of these identity-affirming counter-spaces serve as a positive resistance strategy for these students and allows them to maintain a strong racial sense of self in their maintenance of school success. Findings from this study reinforce the importance of having safe spaces in predominantly White learning environments for Black students to escape psychological, emotional, and physical stress stemming from experiences with racism.

EJ897049,Variability in Schools' Suspension Rates of Black Students,"Black students are frequently suspended at much higher rates than students from other races or ethnicities. Analyses of suspension data over a three-year period were conducted to explain between-school variability in the percentages of Black students suspended in secondary schools at a large urban school district. Results of hierarchical backward elimination indicated that suspensions could be explained by the suspension percentages of non-Black students, increases in achievement discrepancies between Black and non-Black students, and schools' average years of experience of the instructional staff. With these variables in the model, the percentages of Black student enrollment, of Black instructional staff, of male instructional staff, and of novice instructional staff did not predict Black student suspension. The percentages of students who participated in the free/reduced lunch program was initially retained in the student model, but was replaced by the experience of the instructional staff. Specific research is suggested to clarify mechanisms of action and allow generation of well-targeted recommendations for school districts.

This is particularly evident at predominately White institutions (PWIs), despite increasing enrollment of African Americans at these institutions. Previous studies have linked psychosocial health of African American students with positive educational outcomes. Using qualitative data from a study of first-year African American students at a PWI, this article examines the influence of racial identity development on the educational experiences through an interpretive theoretical framework--the Multidimensional Model of Racial Identity (MMRI). Five themes are presented, representing the influence of both internal reconceptualization of racial identity and external sources of support.

EJ973546,Racial Microaggressions: The Narratives of African American Faculty at a Predominantly White University,"What role does race play in the lives of fourteen African American (7 women, 7 men) faculty on a predominantly White campus? This case study focuses on their narratives which revealed that racial microaggressions were a common and negative facet of their lives on campus. Specifically, their narratives suggest interactions of microinvalidations with White colleagues and microinsults with White students. This faculty responded to racial microaggressions by creating campus change and safe space for students of color. Given the potential negative outcomes of racial microaggression, these findings suggest that work is needed to improve the campus climate for African American faculty.

No study to date has tested the entire causal process posited by the hypothesis. This article uses the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002, nationally representative data, to test the process on high school students. The results lend no support to the process predicted by the ""acting White"" hypothesis for African American students, but they do show that African American students receive lower academic ""payoffs"" from their socioeconomic status than do White students.

This study examines race differences in children's participation in after-school programs, an out-of-school time experience that may influence children's achievement. Using nationally representative data spanning 1995-2005, the authors find that African American children ages 6-12 are twice as likely to attend after-school programs as White children, and the gap in program use is growing. Race differences in family and neighborhood characteristics explain only a small portion of the gap in program use, leaving much of the difference unexplained.

EJ966487,"Competition, Conflict, and Coalitions: Black-Latino/a Relations within Institutions of Higher Education","This case study examines Black-Latino/a relations at a public university in California, which has a 31% Black and 40% Latino/a student population. In-depth interviews with students and administrators indicate that Black and Latino/a students do recognize that they share similar educational and socioeconomic obstacles; however, there is little to no Black-Latino/a coalition building because Blacks and Latino/as have been lulled into a false sense of security given their numeric majority on campus. While there is little overt conflict between the two groups, Black-Latino/a relations remain tenuous on campus, as Black-Latino/a tensions in the surrounding community have spilled onto campus, Black and Latino/a students compete against one another for scarce resources, and students of both racial groups tend to stereotype and mistrust one another. This research suggests that high schools and universities can be proactive in easing Black-Latino/a tensions by implementing conflict resolution and peace-building programs, offering ethnic studies courses that emphasize the intertwined histories of Blacks and Latino/as, encouraging administrators and staff to role model positive Black-Latino/a relations, and building relationships with Black-Latino/a political coalitions, which already exist off-campus.","Literte\, Patricia E.","Ethnic Studies,Race,Role Models,Conflict,Conflict Resolution,College Students,Competition,African American Students,Hispanic American Students,Racial Relations,Case Studies,State Universities,Interviews,Student Attitudes,Administrator Attitudes,Socioeconomic Status,Stereotypes,Trust (Psychology),High Schools,Peace,Educational Strategies","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2011,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

Regardless of the type of institution they attended, women respondents earned significantly less than male counterparts. Peer orientation of outside work during college was a negative predictor for career earnings. The analysis of supplemental data suggests that a higher percentage of African American students attending HBCUs reported strong growth in job-related skills and preparation for graduate/professional schools than their counterparts at HWCUs. According to the variability analysis, African Americans' early career earnings are most likely a function of individual assets or characteristics rather than of institutional characteristics.

The results generally reveal race to be a stronger predictor of class enrollment than gender. White students, regardless of gender, tend to enroll in advanced academic courses at a higher rate than do Black students. However, when comparing actual to expected enrollment based on average SAT scores, there does appear to be a gendered difference within each racial category.

The concepts of toughness, aggressiveness, material wealth. restrictive emotionality, and responsibility underscored the meanings the participants ascribed to masculinities. Participants expressed these concepts behaviorally through their pursuit of leadership and academic success, homophobia, and the fear of femininity, and through the sexist and constrained relationships they experienced with women.

EJ942387,"Swords, Shields, and the Fight for Our Children: Lessons from Urban Prep","The grim statistics are well known, but bear repeating: in Chicago, close to 60% of Black boys do not graduate from high school, and only one in forty receive a bachelor's degree by age 25. In the fall of 2006, Urban Prep Charter Academy for Young Men-Englewood Campus, the nation's first all-male charter public high school, was opened. In 2010 and 2011, 100% of the members of each of its first two graduating classes were admitted to attend four-year colleges or universities. The key to its success has been an ability to build a community that values college education and believes in the ability of its students to achieve. In some places, those values and beliefs are taken for granted; but in Englewood--a neighborhood long-plagued by drugs, gang violence, and some of the nation's worst-performing public schools--building that community took careful focus and clear doing. Listening to students, one finds that they need as much help with their personal, social, and emotional development as they do with their academics. Responding to this need, Urban Prep trains its faculty and staff to focus on equipping students with tools for coping with the personal challenges they face today, as well as the academic challenges they face heading into the future. The author calls these tools &quot;swords&quot; and &quot;shields.&quot; Swords enable students to master fields of knowledge. The vast majority of students enter high school needing remediation in core content areas, so instructors must excel at communicating information and developing knowledge to hone students' intellect. Just as importantly, teachers must know or be trained to collect data and information which pinpoint these deficiencies so that instruction can be tailored to students' abilities. Urban Prep emphasizes the need for all its teachers to help students develop &quot;shields&quot; to carry them through adversity. Shields are the tools of reflection, inquiry, and self-expression that build resilience in difficult times.

EJ942388,From Maybe I Can to Yes I Can: Developing Pre-Service and Inservice Teachers' Self-Efficacy to Teach African American Students,"In this article, the authors describe self-efficacy building activities that practitioners can use in the preparation of teachers who are efficacious in their ability to teach African American students. The general principle underlying these suggested activities is that preparing teachers should entail fostering the development of competence and confidence. Becoming an effective teacher of African American students requires both the acquisition of related skills and the self-efficacy beliefs to put those skills to use, Practitioners are encouraged to explore ways in which these and similar activities can be incorporated into all facets of teacher education.","Siwatu\, Kamau Oginga,Frazier\, Paul,Osaghae\, Osariemen J.,Starker\, Tehia V.","African American Students,Self Efficacy,Preservice Teachers,Teacher Education,Teacher Effectiveness,Teacher Attitudes,Skill Development,Cultural Awareness,Culturally Relevant Education,Intervention,Teaching Experience","Journal Articles,Reports - Descriptive",2011,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

EJ942390,(Re)Framing Diverse Pre-Service Classrooms as Spaces for Culturally Relevant Teaching,"Our field is ushering in a new generation of teachers who need experiences that will prepare them to acknowledge the multiple worldviews of the diverse student population they will teach. For pre-service teachers working in urban under-resourced classrooms, constructing alternative practices rooted in critical ideology that honors their students' inquiry is a difficult task. To examine the complexities of this process, this article presents findings from a case study designed to understand how one pre-service teacher navigated the sociopolitical terrain of her middle school curricula and the pedagogical choices she made to create an engaging learning environment. Findings indicate that she fostered pedagogical third spaces to mediate conversations about diversity, equity, and social change with her middle school students.

EJ942391,Key Theories and Frameworks for Improving the Recruitment and Retention of African American Students in Gifted Education,"An issue of much concern, and under much scrutiny and debate, is the persistent and extensive under-representation of African American students in gifted education. A number of efforts have been proposed and implemented to improve their recruitment and retention, but to little or no avail Progress has been slow or non-existent in many cases. In this article, we propose that several theories and conceptual frameworks can guide educators and decision makers in gaining a better understanding of under-representation. In understanding the barriers to recruitment and retention through the lens of theories and frameworks. we can develop solutions that work. Nine theories and frameworks are presented.

Individual interviews were conducted with men and boys within the context of their home environment; outside of the schools the boys attended. The participants' schooling experiences call for establishing a model of collective achievement that captures and delineates the engagement and investment of the multiple stakeholders involved in their education. Such a model will bring about a higher level of multiple stakeholder accountability that would likely improve students' schooling experiences and increase the academic and life outcomes for African American males.

Literacy training combined two essential skills: (a) ongoing assessment of literacy achievement and (b) evidenced-based intervention strategies. Pre- and post-assessment results revealed that the phonics approach was the most frequently used literacy strategy. The least used method of literacy instruction was the use of ongoing or informal literacy assessments. Although the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills was modeled as an example of an ongoing assessment, post-assessment results revealed that educators did not frequently use this assessment. The most utilized literacy intervention strategies were teacher-directed activities implemented at the class-wide level. (Contains 4 tables.)","Williams\, Stacy A.

The authors examined 206 African American students to identify the role of parental involvement as a buffer in the relation between low school support and high academic expectations. Results revealed that high levels of school support and parental involvement facilitated the development of high academic expectations. Sex and socioeconomic status (SES) differences were also examined. High parental involvement and high SES positively influenced academic expectations for females only. For males, low parental involvement and high SES positively influenced academic expectations. These findings suggest that parental involvement has differing effects on academic outcomes for African American males and females.

Fordice&quot; was decided in the United States Supreme Court in 1992, and it represents the most recent ruling on desegregation for those states that have historically maintained racially segregated systems of higher education. This study raises the question of what would Mississippi higher education be without public HBCUs? This study will examine the impact of the closure, merger, and mandated enrollment of public HBCUs in Mississippi. Specifically, it will examine the impact of the closures, mergers, and mandated integration of HBCUs in Mississippi on student access and selected student outcomes for African Americans. Time-series statistical modeling is used in this study to predict the participation and outcomes of African American students for Mississippi's current system of higher education with HBCUs. It also provides policy prescriptions to states that are seeking to dismantle the dual system of higher education.

Moreover, the fact that this conversation is taking place in ""The Journal of Negro Education"" (""JNE"") demonstrates once again that the ""JNE"" has its finger firmly on the pulse of significant educational and societal issues within the Black community. The author's preliminary discussions with the co-editors were quite remarkable in the sense that as they considered books to review to round out this special issue, they found that there was a dearth of recently published works concerning the relationship between the African American Church and educational outcomes. As they delved deeper into the issue they found this observation to be revealing, considering the historic relationship between faith, education, and the Black community. Furthermore, this observation is even more surprising with the recognition that from the Jim Crow era through the Civil Rights generation, the archetype of leadership, the professional class and the overall foundation of the Black community has been primarily composed of preachers and teachers.

The study explored how these women leaders navigated intersecting oppressions as they engaged in social justice in their schools and the role of religio-spirituality in that process. One such emerging theme in their narratives was their re/conceptualization of traditional notions of care in their schools in which large numbers of African American students are served.

Therefore, this article will unearth Yosso's notion of alternative capital that students of color have at their disposal and the Black church's role in its nourishment. Alas, educators and administrators who are charged with educating African American students have, in many cases, been negligent in their efforts to recognize such contrarian capital. This has been mainly due to the fact that schools are undergirded by precepts of implicit and explicit racial biases. The authors will attempt to add to the notion of pedagogy of self-development as we elucidate that such a cogent standard to traditional capital is doing increasing harm and contributing to the on-going academic decline of mans African American students in U S. schools.

Personal faith included belief and adherence to any religion. The results of the three meta-analyses indicated that: (a) personal religious faith was one the two largest factors that consistently reduced the achievement gap: (b) personal religious commitment reduces the achievement gap by 50%; and (c) attending a religious school reduced the achievement gap by 25%.

We examined how understandings of religion inform how American Muslims view, behave, and imagine their role in school. The first author conducted interviews over the course of a year with four American Muslims, two of whom chose not to pursue postsecondary education and two who did. In conjunction with interview responses, bracketing allowed for a conscious, transparent interpretation of data. The findings indicate the presence of two distinctive approaches in how indigenous American Muslims imagine themselves and behave educationally. In one mode, American Muslim religious identity has both appropriated and developed strands and discursive practices that hinder and even prevent successful educational attainment. In another, they sought extensive education but had nonobservant religious identities. Finally, this research reports on how traditional American institutions of agency, which often facilitate educational success, are viewed by American Muslims.

EJ943050,Faith in the Unseen: The Intersection(s) of Spirituality and Identity among African American Males in College,"The author explored spiritual identity constructions and intersections among 24 African American male undergraduate students enrolled across 12 different colleges and universities. The author drew on grounded theory, phenomenology, and case study approaches in all aspects of qualitative research design. After conducting semi-structured interviews, three major findings are reported: (a) spirituality is a source of support and dependency, representing one of few vulnerabilities about which participants are open in discourse; (b) spirituality anchors other identities; and (c) tensions exists among these participants spiritual wins and the other selves they identify. Implications include college and church partnerships toward influencing educational outcomes among this participant group. Furthermore, faculty are offered suggestions regarding curricula, assignments, advising, and pedagogy while collegiate personnel writ large are offered strategies for campus diversity, mentoring, and service.

EJ943052,Resolving a Cultural Conflict in the Classroom: An Exploration of Preservice Teachers' Perceptions of Effective Interventions,"This study employed qualitative research methods to explore preservice teachers' thoughts about the effectiveness of interventions designed to resolve a cultural conflict involving an African American student. Ninety-five preservice teachers in the Southwest read a 300-word case study that was followed by four experienced teachers' responses and their proposed culturally or non-culturally responsive interventions. Participants were asked to identify which of the four interventions were most and least effective and supplement their responses with an explanation. The results revealed that most preservice teachers were aware of the effectiveness of interventions that incorporated the student's culture into the teaching and learning process. A few preservice teachers however, questioned the effectiveness of interventions that ""overemphasised the role of culture."" The implications of these findings are discussed.

The authors expected academic self-esteem to be positively associated with future expectations (academic and general). They expected perceptions of school-based social support to have positive associations with achievement outcomes. They also investigated if there are gender differences in any of the variables. The participants were 206 African American adolescents (65.54% female) who resided in a large urban city in the south-central geographic area of the United States. Results supported the notion that educational resilience was associated with perceived school support, academic self-esteem and mother's work history.

This gap is a measure of the difference between the educational level students said they aspired to reach reported in 1988 when attending 8th grade versus the education level they actually attained in 2006. Hierarchical OLS regression modeling reveals that after controlling for a variety of family, individual, and economic characteristics; parental involvement in a child's school life (social capital) is a predictor of a student's educational attainment, However, findings also reveal that investment in social capital does not necessarily make up for low levels of human capital. The authors offer suggestions for future theorizing and research in contextualizing the aspiration-attainment gap among Black students.

It demonstrates how study of the classics helped construct the tools of Black agency by imparting three important lessons: the knowledge that African Americans were indeed linked to the classical civilizations through northern Africa, which therefore gave them the inherent right to study the classics; the development of leadership training, particularly through study of the classical rhetoricians; and a variety of techniques of resistance, ranging from dissimulation to overt acts of physical resistance. The authors use three case examples: Howe Institute in Memphis, Tennessee; the J. K.

EJ764593,African American Student Representation in Special Education Programs,"In the present quantitative and qualitative study, school psychologists provided responses to a paper-and-pencil survey about their perceptions of the disproportionate representation of African American students in special education. They described their perceptions of the causes and solutions for overrepresentation by providing ratings on structured items as well as responding to open-ended questions. Respondents' previous training in multicultural issues was assessed using an original scale based on recommendations for school psychological practice with racially and culturally diverse students. An important goal of the study was to understand school psychologists' beliefs about disproportionate representation because they are often considered the doorkeepers of special education. Results of a principle components factor analysis revealed that participants considered lack of parental involvement and broadly defined cultural disadvantage, the failures of both the regular education and special education systems, and pressures from parents and teachers to place African American students as the most influential factors that represent African American students in special education. Furthermore, the self-reported cross-cultural competence of participants was found to be associated with the likelihood that solutions to the above named problems would be implemented.

EJ764597,Non-Cognitive Predictors of Academic Achievement for African Americans across Cultural Contexts,"Two hundred-fifty African American college students from two predominantly White institutions (PWIs) and two historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) were administered the Non-Cognitive Questionnaire-Revised (NCQ-R) and the Multidimensional Inventory of Black Identity (MIBI) to determine which psychosocial indices best predicted academic achievement across cultural contexts. It was hypothesized that some non-cognitive factors of academic achievement would generalize across institution-types, while others would be more context-specific. Results show that of the psychosocial indices that reliably predicted African American achievement, none generalized across institution-types. At PWIs, availability of academic support person, ability to understand and deal with racism, and humanist attitudes were the most reliable predictors of academic achievement. At HBCUs, positive academic self-concept was the only non-cognitive factor that surfaced as a good predictor of achievement for African Americans. The study underscores the importance of cultural context in determining non-cognitive predictors of academic achievement for African American college students.

While previous research produced inconsistent results, the present study revealed that participation in school-based sports was associated with a reduction in cigarette and marijuana use, thus, serving as a protective factor for Black and White students. However, the protective role of sports involvement for alcohol use was present only among Black females. Participation in sports was associated with an increase in alcohol use (serving as a risk factor) among White males and females and Black males (after controlling for conventional predictors of alcohol use in adolescence). Implications for expanding the role of sports as a potential school resource in drug use prevention planning are discussed.

Because middle schools are essential links in the sequence of opportunities to learn, it is imperative to understand the social and educational forces that influence academic outcomes for this age group of adolescents. The authors examine the contributions of family, school, and individual factors to academic outcomes. Using survey research data gathered from a representative sample of middle school English classes in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School (CMS) system, the article investigates how the various factors contribute to academic outcomes as measured by students' North Carolina End-of-Grade (EOG) standardized test scores. Findings indicate that although there are no gender differences in achievement in 2nd grade, differences become evident by middle school, with females obtaining higher test scores and grades than males. Although prior achievement and track placement affect all students in expected ways, males' test scores are more likely to be affected by peers, educational attitudes, school structure, and school climate. Females' test scores are more likely to be influenced by family socioeconomic status and cultural capital. The article shows how 8th-grade Black males' lower level of academic performance begins to take shape and to align in ways that foreshadow the disappointing school outcomes associated with older Black male students.

EJ764604,Dress Codes Blues: An Exploration of Urban Students' Reactions to a Public High School Uniform Policy,"This qualitative investigation explores the responses of 22 U.S. urban public high school students when confronted with their newly imposed school uniform policy. Specifically, the study assessed students' appraisals of the policy along with compliance and academic performance. Guided by ecological human development perspectives and grounded in theory-based qualitative analysis, the study elucidated the themes that emerged in relevant student narratives. Findings indicated that the overwhelming majority of students were opposed to and non-compliant with the school uniform policy, and that these responses were unrelated to school performance. Students developed oppositional strategies designed to undermine the policy and to retain some semblance of freedom and dignity. Suggestions for further research and policy are provided.","DaCosta\, Kneia","Program Effectiveness,Urban Schools,School Uniforms,Dress Codes,High School Students,Public Schools,Student Attitudes,School Policy,Academic Achievement,Student Rights,Vocational Education,African American Students,Compliance (Psychology),Student Behavior","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2006,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Journal of Negro Education.

EJ998545,"""I Am Teaching Some of the Boys:"" Chaplain Robert Boston Dokes and Army Testing of Black Soldiers in World War II","African Americans have served in the United States Armed Forces in nearly every conflict in the nation's history. However, the State--through official government policy, ad hoc decisions of military commanders, or statements by prominent civilians--was rarely comfortable with Black military service. Throughout most of American history, the various branches of the military practiced racial segregation against Black troops. Despite the fact that more than one million Blacks served in the military during World War II, the practice of segregation persisted and shunted the overwhelming majority of Black service personnel into non-combat service units. ""I Am Teaching Some of the Boys"" is based on the experiences of an African American minister-turned Army Chaplain, Reverend Robert Boston Dokes, who defied this tradition. During World War II, officials relied on the Army General Classification Test (AGCT) to determine which soldiers served in which capacities. The AGCT provided convenient cover for an institution that was determined to find a rationalization for racial discrimination. The AGCT was part of a larger assessment environment that controlled promotions, pay grades, and other benefits of military service. Moreover, the invocation of White privilege through testing, especially in a war with Nazi Germany, seemed as an important means of refuting Black claims to full citizenship rights. This article, based, on multi-archival research, will address the efforts of Chaplain Dokes and other reformers to help Black soldiers overcome these institutional limits. Dokes' experience with several Black battalions underscores the impact of the Army's testing regime on Black troops.

EJ998546,Four Effects of the High-Stakes Testing Movement on African American K-12 Students,"In order to ensure that American students are competitive with students in other countries, since the 1980s, U.S. policymakers have been trying to improve the K-12 public school system. Recent reform efforts have led to the current high-stakes testing movement, which measures student achievement and school effectiveness mainly by standardized test scores. In this article, the authors explain how the current high-stakes testing movement has harmed African American students through (1) instructional practices that have not resulted in widespread higher test scores; (2) increasing student apathy; (3) more punitive discipline policies and pushing more youth into the prison pipeline, and also by (4) creating a narcissistic education system that strives to make schools &quot;look good,&quot; even if students are not really learning information that will help them improve the quality of their lives. The authors conclude with recommendations that can improve the schooling experiences of African American youth.","Thompson\, Gail L.,Allen\, Tawannah G.","High Stakes Tests,School Effectiveness,Teaching Methods,African American Students,African American Achievement,African American Education,Educational Practices,Instructional Effectiveness,Educational Policy,Policy Analysis,Educational Assessment,Educational Indicators,Achievement Gap,Educational Change,Achievement Need,Achievement Gains,Discipline Policy","Journal Articles,Reports - Descriptive",2012,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

Educational Standard Setting and Its Effect on African American Test Takers,"Standard setting (the process of establishing minimum passing scores on high-stakes exams) is a highly evaluative and policy-driven process. It is a common belief that standard setting panels should be diverse and representative. There is concern, however, that panelists with varying characteristics may differentially influence the results of the standard-setting process. The purpose of this study is to empirically examine whether or not the judgments of standard-setting panelists are related to select personal characteristics (gender and race/ethnicity) and educational context (geographic region and socioeconomic status) for two high-stakes examinations in one southeastern state. Results suggest that personal characteristics are not systematically related to level of recommended cut scores. Educational context, however, is an influential factor.

Pre-test and post-test assessments that were administered to participating students indicated that the program significantly improved students' performance on a practice test. Implications for student achievement and factors that influence their scores on the SHSAT, standardized tests, and school work are discussed.

EJ998549,Teacher Licensure Exams and Black Teacher Candidates: Toward New Theory and Promising Practice,"""Basic skills"" teacher licensure exams such as Praxis are the first gatekeepers to the teaching profession. Fewer than half of the aspiring Black teachers who take these exams pass on their first attempt. While critiques of these exams are warranted, critiques alone will do little to help certify more Black teachers. This solution-oriented article makes both a theoretical and practical contribution to this area. First, it provides a selected overview of two theoretical areas that have relevance to understanding teacher licensure testing. These theoretical areas are self-efficacy and sociocultural theory. The article then draws from the author's 6 years of preparing Black preservice teachers for licensure exams to illustrate how these theories can shape practice at both programmatic and classroom levels.

EJ998554,Assessing African American Students for Specific Learning Disabilities: The Promises and Perils of Response to Intervention,"Response to Intervention (RtI) consists of multi-tiered instructional delivery systems in which educators provide research-based interventions to students that increase in intensity depending on students' instructional response. RtI is currently being implemented in schools across the United States. RtI's shift away from standardized testing offers new opportunities to consider the ways in which African American students are serviced within the general education setting, the assessment methods deemed appropriate when considering African American students for special education under the Specific Learning Disability category, and how multi-tiered intervention can address the overrepresentation of African American students in special education. This article provides an overview of a three-tiered RtI model, explores the promises and challenges of using RtI with African American students, and delineates a research and direct service delivery agenda to facilitate the development of RtI models that consider the educational needs of African American students.

EJ998555,Universal Screening for Behavioral and Emotional Risk: A Promising Method for Reducing Disproportionate Placement in Special Education,"The overrepresentation of U.S. minority students identified for emotional and behavior disorders special education programs plagues schools and challenges researchers and practitioners. Arcane methods including teacher nomination continue to guide referral processes, despite compelling evidence of their influence on disproportionate special education placement for children of color. As universal screening practices are deployed, emerging evidence suggests that requiring a teacher, parent, or student to complete a rating scale may reduce disproportionality. By using available research to posit that if schools engage in universal screening of behavioral and emotional risk using formal scales, fewer children of color would be placed in special education programs. The logical and evidentiary case for universal screening is made and questions requiring more research are presented.","Raines\, Tara C.,Dever\, Bridget V.,Kamphaus\, Randy W.,Roach\, Andrew T.","Rating Scales,Special Education,Behavior Disorders,Teacher Role,Minority Group Students,Disproportionate Representation,Student Placement,Screening Tests,At Risk Students,Emotional Disturbances,Referral,African American Students","Journal Articles,Reports - Evaluative",2012,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

EJ998556,"An Intercultural Project Exploring the Relationship among DNA Ancestry Profiles, Family Narrative, and the Social Construction of Race","While important goals of the Civil Rights Movement were fulfilled with the election of Barack Obama, ongoing demands to build a just and inclusive multiracial society require that one constantly looks for new ways to extend the discussion of difference. The goal of this article is to present a project designed for students in intercultural communication classes at a midsize, regional university. In the project, undergraduate students are DNA tested for their genetic ancestry, and that information is used as a springboard for discussion of their racial backgrounds and the social construction of race. This presentation outlines the process for project development, discusses major themes for reflection, and makes suggestions for potential project directors.","Foeman\, Anita K.","Civil Rights,Race,Genetics,Reflection,Intercultural Communication,Undergraduate Students,Racial Attitudes,Testing,Program Development,Correlation,Profiles,Program Descriptions,White Students,Personal Narratives,Racial Relations","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2012,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

EJ998562,"Does Geographic Setting Alter the Roles of Academically Supportive Factors? African American Adolescents' Friendships, Math Self-Concept, and Math Performance","The study is one of few to examine how living in rural, suburban, or urban settings may alter factors supporting African Americans adolescents' math performance. The study examines the relationship of math self-concept and perceptions of friends' academic behaviors to African American students' math performance. Participants (N = 1,049) are African American adolescents from rural, suburban, and urban schools. Findings suggest that having higher academic perceptions of friends related to greater math self-concept, which then related positively to math performance for students in all settings. However, urban students had less gender stratification in both academic perceptions of friends and math self-concept. Findings highlight how academically supportive factors are present for African American adolescents in various levels of urbanization.

EJ998569,The Relations of Stressful Events and Nonacademic Future Expectations in African American Adolescents: Gender Differences in Parental Monitoring,"Urban African American high school students (N = 206) completed a study to examine gender differences in parental monitoring and the effect on the relationship between exposure to stressful life events and nonacademic future expectations. Participant's ages range from 13 to 18 (M = 15.78, SD = 1.19). Participants reported high exposure to stressful life events, but also high future expectations. Older girls reported the highest levels of parental monitoring. Parental monitoring showed a moderating effect on the future expectations only for African American adolescent males, who were exposed to a high number of stressful life events. This finding seems to suggest that while older African American adolescent females report the highest levels of parental monitoring, the construct has more of an impact on outcomes for males.

EJ998587,What Makes the Difference? Black Women's Undergraduate and Graduate Experiences in Mathematics,"Despite the increase of women earning degrees in STEM fields, there continues to remain a dearth in the number of women pursuing terminal degrees in mathematics. Additionally, Black women are nearly invisible in the field. This qualitative study examined the undergraduate and graduate experiences of twelve Black women mathematicians. A Black feminist framework embedded with a grounded theory approach was implemented. Variations were discovered for the women who attended an HBCU versus those who attended a non-HBCU for their undergraduate degree. Mentorship, a supportive program, and study groups were prime indicators that the women attributed to their success. Future implications suggest finding ways to minimize feelings of isolation from doctoral programs in mathematics and allowing further opportunities for mentorship.","Borum\, Viveka,Walker\, Erica","Females,Grounded Theory,Doctoral Programs,STEM Education,African American Students,Undergraduate Students,Graduate Students,Educational Experience,Mathematics Education,Feminism,Guidelines,Black Colleges,Mentors,Social Isolation,Student Attitudes","Journal Articles,Reports - Descriptive",2012,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.

EJ998593,Exploring the Meaning African American PETE Teacher Candidates Ascribe to Their Aquatic Experiences,"Physical Education Teacher Education (PETE) programs typically require their graduates to learn to swim proficiently. However, the research base is underdeveloped regarding the aquatic experiences of African Americans in PETE programs. The purpose of this study was to explore the meaning African American PETE teacher candidates ascribe to their aquatic experiences. Participants were six African American teacher candidates. The research design was explanatory multiple-case study. The primary data sources were interviews and weekly journal reflections. Data from these sources were analyzed using the constant comparative method. The teacher candidates ascribed various meanings to their experiences, linking them to successes or traumatic events including criticism and race-based stereotypical views. Nevertheless, overcoming aqua-phobia and striving for success in the aquatic courses were common to the participants' journeys. Recommendations include a series of progressive aquatic courses to help students overcome aqua phobia, when necessary; increase swimming proficiency; and counter race-based sport stereotypes about African Americans.","Sato\, Takahiro,Hodge\, Samuel R.","Physical Education,African American Teachers,Physical Education Teachers,Research Design,Grounded Theory,Aquatic Sports,Black Colleges,Teacher Education,Case Studies,Interviews,African Americans,Focus Groups,Semi Structured Interviews,Stereotypes,Higher Education","Journal Articles,Reports - Research",2012,ISSN-0022-2984,,"Howard University School of Education. 2900 Van Ness Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.
